    "summary": "The 'Keeping Drugs Out of Schools Act of 2025' authorizes grants to eligible entities (coalitions that receive anti-drug abuse funding and have partnerships with local schools) to implement school-community partnerships for preventing substance use and misuse among youth. The grants, capped at $75,000 per year, can be used to implement detailed drug prevention plans and obtain specialized training. The bill also authorizes $7 million for each of fiscal years 2026-2031 for these initiatives. The bill falls under the umbrella of using funds to supplement existing local resources rather than supplant them.",
