    "summary": "This bill, the \"Restoring Safeguards for Dangerous Abortion Drugs Act,\" focuses on mifepristone. It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to reinstate a specific risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for mifepristone, identical to the one in place in June 2011. It also establishes federal liability for entities involved in the illegal import or transport of mifepristone, allowing individuals harmed by the drug to sue for damages. Finally, it bans the importation of mifepristone into the United States, including via mail.",
