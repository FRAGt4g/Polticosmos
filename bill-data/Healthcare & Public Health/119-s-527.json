    "summary": "The 'Prescription Pricing for the People Act of 2025' mandates the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to study intermediaries in the pharmaceutical supply chain (primarily pharmacy benefit managers) and report findings and policy recommendations to Congress. The FTC is to investigate potential anti-competitive practices, including pricing discrepancies, patient steering, data usage, and formulary manipulation. The bill requires a comprehensive report within a year, along with an interim report. It also mandates a report on the FTC's actions related to sole-source drug manufacturers. The aim is to improve transparency, competition, and consumer benefits within the pharmaceutical market.",
