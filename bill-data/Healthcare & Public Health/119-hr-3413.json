    "summary": "The Physician and Patient Safety Act (H.R. 3413) mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create regulations ensuring due process rights for physicians. This includes a fair hearing and appellate review through hospital medical staff mechanisms before any termination, restriction, or reduction of a physician's professional activity or staff privileges.  The bill specifies requirements for these regulations, including that a hearing cannot be denied through third-party contracts, physicians cannot waive their rights as a condition of employment, and proceedings remain confidential unless patient safety is at risk. Regulations are to be effective within 18 months of enactment.",
