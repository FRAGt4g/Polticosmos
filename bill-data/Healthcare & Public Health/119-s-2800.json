    "summary": "This bill, the Pharmacy and Medically Underserved Areas Enhancement Act, amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide Medicare coverage for pharmacist services.  It allows reimbursement for pharmacist-provided services in Health Professional Shortage Areas, medically underserved areas, and medically underserved populations, mirroring coverage if provided by physicians.  The amendments will take effect on January 1, 2027, and require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop pharmacist-specific codes for billing.",
