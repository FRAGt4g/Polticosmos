    "summary": "The Sustainable Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Services in the Home Act (S. 248) aims to permanently extend in-home cardiopulmonary rehabilitation flexibilities initially established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill amends the Social Security Act to codify virtual cardiopulmonary rehabilitation via telehealth, expand originating sites for these services, and direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish standards and allow certain programs to utilize telehealth. These changes are designed to improve access to and delivery of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation services.",
