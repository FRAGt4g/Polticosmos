    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 1843, aims to increase transparency in the generic drug application process. It amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to inform applicants seeking to submit abbreviated applications whether their drug is qualitatively and quantitatively the same as the listed drug. If not, the Secretary must identify the differing ingredients and the extent of deviations. The bill also mandates the issuance of guidance on how these determinations will be made, including with regard to pH adjusters, and makes the amendment applicable upon enactment.",
