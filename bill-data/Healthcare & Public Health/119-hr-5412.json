    "summary": "The Food Farmacy Act of 2025 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide grants to establish and operate healthy food pharmacies. These pharmacies aim to improve health outcomes by providing access to nutritious foods and nutritional guidance, particularly for low-income, rural, and food-insecure communities. The grants can be used for construction, equipment, staffing, and food acquisition. Eligible entities include non-profit healthcare providers, state/local governments, and tribal organizations. The bill mandates reporting on the program's effectiveness and authorizes $10 million annually from 2026-2030.",
