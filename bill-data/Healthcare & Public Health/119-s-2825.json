    "summary": "The Health Access Innovation Act of 2025 amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to faith- or community-based organizations. These grants aim to address persistent health inequities and chronic disease challenges by expanding access to care, supporting health workers, and addressing social determinants of health. The bill specifies eligible entities, prioritizes those with prior public health emergency experience, and authorizes specific appropriations for fiscal years 2026-2030.",
