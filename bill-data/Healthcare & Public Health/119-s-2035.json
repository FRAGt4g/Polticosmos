    "summary": "The Protect IVF Act (S. 2035) aims to establish statutory rights for individuals to access fertility treatments and for healthcare providers to offer them. It prevents states from enacting restrictions on fertility services that are inconsistent with widely accepted medical standards. The bill defines fertility treatments broadly, outlines rights for patients, providers, health insurance issuers, and manufacturers, and provides for enforcement through civil actions. It also includes provisions for state regulation and preemption of conflicting state laws.",
