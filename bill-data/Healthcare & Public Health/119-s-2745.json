    "summary": "The Federal Firefighter Cancer Detection and Prevention Act of 2025 mandates the Department of Defense to provide free medical testing and related services to detect and prevent cancer in its firefighters. These services include screenings for breast, colon, and prostate cancer, as well as other cancers identified by the CDC. The bill outlines specific criteria for testing frequency and review by licensed professionals, allows firefighters to opt out, and emphasizes data collection, privacy protection, and potential sharing with the CDC to improve cancer understanding among firefighters.",
