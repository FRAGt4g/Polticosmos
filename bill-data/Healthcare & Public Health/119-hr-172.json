    "summary": "The \"Defund Heroin Injection Centers Act of 2025\" (H.R. 172) is a bill that aims to prohibit the use of federal funds for any state, local, tribal, or private entity that operates or controls a supervised injection center. The legislation asserts that such facilities are in violation of Section 416 of the Controlled Substances Act, commonly known as the \"Crack House Statute.\" By cutting off federal financial support, the bill seeks to prevent the establishment and operation of these centers, which are sometimes utilized as a harm reduction strategy in response to the opioid crisis.",
