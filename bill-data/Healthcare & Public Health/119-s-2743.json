    "summary": "The 'Save Our Safety-Net Hospitals Act of 2025' amends Title XIX of the Social Security Act to modify limitations on disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payment adjustments under the Medicaid program. It redefines which services and patients are considered for DSH payments, specifically including those covered by Medicare and applicable plans.  The bill also allows states to redistribute unspent DSH allotments retroactively, subject to certain conditions, and permits retroactive modifications to state Medicaid plans to facilitate increased payments. It clarifies payment rules and provides guidelines for state reporting.",
