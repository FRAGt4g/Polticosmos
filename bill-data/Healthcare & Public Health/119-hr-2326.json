    "summary": "The Dietary Guidelines Reform Act of 2025 amends the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act of 1990 to improve dietary guidelines. Key changes include requiring updates at least every 10 years (with potential for more frequent updates), establishing an Independent Advisory Board, mandating evidence-based reviews, and increasing transparency regarding conflicts of interest. The bill also specifies funding for these activities and clarifies that the 2020 Dietary Guidelines remain in effect until the first report under the amended Act is published.",
