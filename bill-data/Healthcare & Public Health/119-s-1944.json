    "summary": "The Employee Access to Worksite Health Services Act allows individuals with access to on-site healthcare services through their employer to contribute to a health savings account (HSA) on a pre-tax basis. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify this eligibility, specifying what constitutes \"qualified items and services\" provided at these facilities, including physical examinations, immunizations, and treatment for work-related injuries, among other services linked to preventative care for certain chronic conditions.  The provision would take effect for taxable years starting after December 31, 2025.",
