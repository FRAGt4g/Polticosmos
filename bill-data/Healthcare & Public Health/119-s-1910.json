    "summary": "The Real Education and Access for Healthy Youth Act of 2025 aims to improve the sexual health and well-being of young people. It establishes grant programs for sex education in schools (K-12 and higher education), educator training, and sexual health services for underserved youth. The bill emphasizes evidence-based, comprehensive, and inclusive sex education that addresses topics like consent, gender identity, and interpersonal violence. It also defines key terms related to sexual health and reproductive justice, alongside funding allocations and reporting requirements. Funding comes from authorized appropriations and the reprogramming of abstinence-only program funds.",
