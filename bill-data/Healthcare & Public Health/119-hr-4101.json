    "summary": "The Cancer Drug Parity Act of 2025 (H.R. 4101) amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to ensure that group health plans provide cost-sharing for oral anticancer drugs on terms no less favorable than those for intravenously administered anticancer medications. The bill defines cost-sharing and restricts plans from making changes that would increase out-of-pocket costs or impose more restrictive limitations on oral medications. It also mandates a GAO study on the impact of the act on out-of-pocket costs and access to these medications.",
