    "summary": "The Prioritizing Rural Hospitals Act aims to improve healthcare access in rural areas by prioritizing healthcare and mental/behavioral health facilities for Community Facilities program loans and grants (2026-2031). The bill allows funds to be used for medical supplies, telehealth expansion, staffing support (up to 25% of funds), and renovation of closed facilities. It also prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from making national reprioritizations within the program during the same period.",
