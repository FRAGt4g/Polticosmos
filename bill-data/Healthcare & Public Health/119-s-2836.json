    "summary": "The 'Patients Over Profit Act' (POP Act) aims to prohibit common ownership between health insurance issuers and certain healthcare providers under Medicare. It mandates divestiture if such ownership exists, allowing for civil actions and FTC review. The bill amends the Social Security Act to enforce this prohibition in Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, defining key terms such as 'applicable provider' and 'management services organization'. The goal is to prevent conflicts of interest and protect patient care by separating financial interests in healthcare.",
