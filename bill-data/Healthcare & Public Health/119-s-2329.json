    "summary": "The Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Patient-Centered Care Act (S. 2329) aims to improve Medicare beneficiaries' access to orthotic and prosthetic care. It prohibits payments for orthotics and prosthetics delivered via drop shipment, exempts additional practitioners from competitive acquisition, and ensures beneficiary access to replacement custom-fitted and custom-fabricated orthotics. The bill also mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations within a year of the Act's enactment to implement the changes.",
