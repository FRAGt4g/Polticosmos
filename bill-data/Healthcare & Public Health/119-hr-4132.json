    "summary": "The Prescription Information Modernization Act of 2025 aims to modernize how prescribing information for drugs is communicated. It allows manufacturers to provide this information electronically, while ensuring prescribers and dispensers can opt for paper copies. The bill mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations for implementation and hold a public workshop to optimize accessibility and usability. The effective date is tied to either two years after enactment or the implementation of final regulations.",
