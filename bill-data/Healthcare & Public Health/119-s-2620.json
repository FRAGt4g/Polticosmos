    "summary": "This bill, the \"Reforming Evergreening and Manipulation that Extends Drug Years Act\" (REMEDY Act), amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act concerning generic drug approval. It aims to limit \"evergreening\" practices by drug manufacturers, where they extend patent protection through minor modifications. The bill introduces the concept of a \"covered patent\" for each new drug approval, restricting the patent that can trigger the 30-month stay on generic drug approval. It clarifies procedures related to patent infringement actions and the timing of generic drug approvals.",
