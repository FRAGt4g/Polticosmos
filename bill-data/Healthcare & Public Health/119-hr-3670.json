    "summary": "The IHS Provider Expansion Act aims to improve healthcare access for Indigenous communities. It amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to establish an Office of Graduate Medical Education Programs within the Indian Health Service (IHS). This office will oversee current residency and fellowship programs, facilitate the creation of new programs, and coordinate with academic institutions to cultivate a pipeline for healthcare professionals. An interagency working group will support the office's establishment and long-term sustainability, reporting to Congress quarterly for 10 years. The bill authorizes appropriations of at least $4 million annually, starting in fiscal year 2027.",
