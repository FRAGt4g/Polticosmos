    "summary": "This bill, the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act, mandates the Secretary of Labor to establish an occupational safety and health standard requiring healthcare and social service employers to create and implement comprehensive workplace violence prevention plans. These plans must include risk assessments, hazard controls, training, incident reporting, and record-keeping. The bill also amends the Social Security Act to ensure that hospitals and skilled nursing facilities that receive Medicare funds adhere to the workplace violence prevention standard. The goal is to protect healthcare workers, social service workers and other personnel from violence.",
