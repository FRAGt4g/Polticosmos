    "summary": "This bill, the \"Independent Broker Relief and Oversight of Knowingly Egregious and Repetitive Sales Tactics In Medicare Enrollment Act of 2025,\" aims to regulate independent agents, brokers, and third-party marketing organizations (TPMOs) involved in Medicare enrollment. It mandates rulemaking for defining TPMOs, overseeing predatory call centers (including potential rewards for whistleblowers), and establishing a standardized registration process for independent agents and brokers. Further, it nullifies the 48-hour waiting period requirement for appointments made by independent agents and brokers and directs the Inspector General to review potentially fraudulent marketing practices and report to Congress.
