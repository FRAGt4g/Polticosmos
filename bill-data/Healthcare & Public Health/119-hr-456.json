    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 456, titled the \"Protecting Dogs Subjected to Experiments Act,\" was introduced in the House of Representatives by Mr. Steube. The legislation seeks to prohibit the use of federal funds by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for any biological, medical, or behavioral research that involves experiments on dogs. If enacted, this bill would effectively defund all dog testing conducted or supported by the NIH, a major source of funding for biomedical research in the United States, based on animal welfare concerns.",
