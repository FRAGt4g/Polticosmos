    "summary": "This bill, the Ensuring Access to Specialty Care Everywhere Act (EASE Act), amends the Social Security Act to require the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to test a model improving access to specialty health services for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The model involves the Secretary entering agreements with provider networks to deliver specialty care through digital modalities like telehealth, focusing on individuals in rural or underserved areas. The provider networks must meet specific criteria regarding size, non-profit status, experience, and data capabilities. Funding for this initiative is subject to existing requirements for certain Public Health Service Act programs.",
