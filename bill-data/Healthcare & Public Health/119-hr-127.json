    "summary": "This bill establishes an exemption from the individual health insurance mandate for people in counties with fewer than two insurers on the ACA exchange. It also mandates that Members of Congress, congressional staff, the President, Vice President, and political appointees enroll in health coverage through the ACA exchanges. The act would prohibit government contributions toward their premiums, effectively ending the employer subsidy for these officials. It also limits their eligibility for tax credits and cost-sharing reductions to the same level as any other citizen, aiming for 'congressional equity' with the public.",
