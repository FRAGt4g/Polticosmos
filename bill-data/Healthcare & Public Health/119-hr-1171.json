    "summary": "The 'Stopping Addiction and Falls for the Elderly Act' (SAFE Act) amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to include physical and occupational therapists in Medicare's annual wellness visits, specifically addressing fall risk assessment and prevention. It mandates the inclusion of fall risk assessments and fall prevention services for individuals who have fallen in the previous year. The bill also includes outpatient occupational and physical therapy services in the initial preventive physical examination for those who have experienced a fall. It also requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report annually to Congress on falls in individuals 65 and older.",
