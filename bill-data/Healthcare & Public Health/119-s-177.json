    "summary": "This bill, the Protect Funding for Women's Health Care Act, aims to prohibit federal funding for Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its affiliates. It asserts that other healthcare providers can adequately serve women's health needs, including services like contraception, screenings, and referrals. The bill explicitly states that the redistribution of funds would not affect existing abortion-related restrictions or reduce overall federal funding for women's health.",
