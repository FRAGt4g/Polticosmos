    "summary": "The Safeguarding Medicaid Act aims to strengthen asset verification for Medicaid eligibility. It mandates asset verification programs for all applicants and recipients in all states and territories. The bill amends the Social Security Act to eliminate certain exemptions for asset testing and requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a federal tracking system for savings related to asset verification programs. States must submit reports detailing eligibility determinations and renewals, and the Secretary can enforce compliance through corrective action plans. The bill's main focuses are the application of asset tests and the reporting and analysis of information for Medicaid eligibility purposes.",
