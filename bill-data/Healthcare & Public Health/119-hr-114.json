The repeal is scheduled to take effect on October 1, 2025. The bill stipulates that all laws amended or repealed by these acts would be restored to their original state, effectively reversing the legislative framework commonly known as 'Obamacare' and its associated reconciliation bill without proposing a replacement.",
