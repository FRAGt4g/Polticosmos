    "summary": "This bill, the Access to Pediatric Technologies Act of 2025, amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to improve patient access to pediatric medical technologies. It mandates that the Secretary of Health and Human Services establish national relative value units for qualifying pediatric technologies under the physician fee schedule, upon manufacturer request. Qualifying technologies must be medical devices covered under the title, approved by the FDA, described by a temporary HCPCS code, and predominantly used or specifically designed for pediatric patients. The bill outlines the process for manufacturers to request payment rates and specifies the timeline for implementation. It clarifies that the provision does not mandate coverage and doesn't alter existing coverage requirements.",
