    "summary": "The Access to Birth Control Act aims to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure pharmacies provide FDA-approved contraception and related medications to customers without undue delay. Pharmacies must offer options like referrals, transfers, or expedited ordering if a medication isn't in stock. The bill defines responsibilities to prevent intimidation, misrepresentation, or breaches of confidentiality regarding contraception. It also outlines civil penalties and a private right of action for violations, while clarifying that state laws providing greater customer protections are not preempted. The bill addresses reports of pharmacists denying birth control and asserts that access to contraception should not be hindered by personal beliefs or professional clinical judgment. It defines relevant terms, and dictates an effective date.",
