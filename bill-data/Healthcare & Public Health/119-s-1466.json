    "summary": "The 'Resources for Victims of Gun Violence Act of 2025' establishes a federal advisory council to support victims of gun violence. The council will assess needs, disseminate information on resources and best practices, and publish reports. It will also gather public input. The Department of Health and Human Services will lead the council, which will include representatives from various federal agencies, victim advocates, and victims of gun violence. The Act defines 'gun violence' broadly and outlines the council's duties, including assessing programs and providing information on medical, financial, and other support services. The council will sunset after five years with no additional funding allocated.",
