    "summary": "The Dietary Guidelines Reform Act of 2025 amends the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act of 1990. It aims to improve the dietary guidelines by requiring reviews every 10 years (with potential for more frequent updates), mandating evidence-based review methodologies, and establishing an Independent Advisory Board. The bill specifies the content of the guidelines, emphasizing scientific consensus, nutritional adequacy, and affordability. It also addresses conflicts of interest and allocates funding for implementation, and sets forth transparency requirements. The bill clarifies that the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans will remain in effect until the first report is published under the amended act.",
