    "summary": "The 'OTC Monograph Drug User Fee Transparency Act' aims to increase transparency and reporting related to over-the-counter (OTC) drug monographs. It amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by requiring the FDA to include detailed information in its annual reports, such as processing timelines and postmarket safety activities. It also mandates the public release of minutes from negotiation meetings between the FDA and the regulated industry. Lastly, it calls for a GAO report assessing the supply chain of OTC monograph drugs.",
