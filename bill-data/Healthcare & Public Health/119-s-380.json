    "summary": "The Rural Obstetrics Readiness Act aims to improve obstetric emergency care in rural areas. It establishes a training program for practitioners in rural healthcare facilities without dedicated obstetric units to handle obstetric emergencies, including training on identifying, stabilizing, and transferring patients. The bill provides grant funding for equipment, supplies, and workforce capacity building. It also includes a pilot program for teleconsultation to support urgent maternal healthcare and mandates a study on maternity ward closures and regional obstetric care partnerships.",
