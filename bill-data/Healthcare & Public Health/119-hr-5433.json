    "summary": "The Patients Over Profit Act (POP Act) aims to prohibit common ownership between health insurance issuers and certain healthcare providers under Medicare. The bill mandates divestiture of either the provider or the issuer within a specified timeframe, with civil actions possible for violations. It also amends the Social Security Act to prevent Medicare Advantage organizations from contracting with entities under common ownership with applicable providers. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is granted rulemaking authority and is required to review divestitures to assess their impact on competition and public interest.",
