    "summary": "This bill, the Restore Protections for Dialysis Patients Act, aims to reinforce protections for individuals with end-stage renal disease under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act. It prohibits health plans from discriminating against dialysis patients or shifting financial responsibility to Medicare. The bill clarifies that limitations on benefits, especially regarding dialysis, should not disadvantage these patients, while also allowing plans to manage their provider networks. The bill amends Section 1862(b)(1)(C) of the Social Security Act to reflect these changes.",
