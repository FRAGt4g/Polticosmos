    "summary": "This bill, the \"Pregnancy Is Not an Illness Act of 2025,\" aims to prevent the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), from considering pregnancy as an illness when approving abortion drugs.  It specifically targets approvals under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The bill mandates the nullification of any existing abortion drug approvals that relied on treating pregnancy as an illness, with specific mention of mifepristone.",
