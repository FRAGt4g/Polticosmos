    "summary": "This bill, the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act, amends Title 35 of the United States Code to address patent infringement related to biological products. It focuses on the process by which biosimilar manufacturers (subsection (k) applicants) can be sued for patent infringement by reference product sponsors, limiting the number of patents that can be asserted in such cases. The bill specifies conditions and exceptions for this limitation, including provisions for increased patent assertions under certain circumstances, and ensures the limitations only apply if the subsection (k) applicant complies with the required actions. It also mandates the changes apply to applications submitted after the enactment date.",
