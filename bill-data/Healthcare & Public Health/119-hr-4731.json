    "summary": "This bill, the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2025, aims to address the shortage of resident physicians. It amends the Social Security Act to provide for the distribution of additional residency positions (2,000 per year from 2026-2032) to qualifying hospitals. These positions are allocated based on various criteria, including hospitals already over resident limits, those in rural areas or serving health professional shortage areas, and those affiliated with historically Black medical schools. The bill also mandates a study on increasing diversity in the healthcare workforce and requires a report from the Comptroller General.",
