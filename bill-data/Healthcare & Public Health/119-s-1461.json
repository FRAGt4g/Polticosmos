    "summary": "The 'Safe and Secure Housing for Opioid Recovery and Enduring Stability Act of 2025' (Safe SHORES Act of 2025) reauthorizes the recovery housing program, amending the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. It increases funding, modifies reporting requirements, and allows states to use funds for furniture. The bill mandates the Secretary to monitor grants via a database, encourages states to prioritize funding for facilities implementing workforce development, and requires annual reports to Congress on the program's outcomes, including resident statistics and best practices to improve recovery and placement into stable housing. It aims to address the needs of those facing substance abuse and promote a more effective construction and expansion of recovery housing.",
