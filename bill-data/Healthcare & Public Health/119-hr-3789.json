    "summary": "This bill, the Drug-price Transparency for Consumers Act of 2025, mandates that direct-to-consumer advertisements for prescription drugs and biological products include pricing information, specifically the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). It exempts medications with a WAC under $35. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to establish regulations for disclosure format and updates. Violators face civil penalties, and the Secretary may use existing reporting on manufacturers for enforcement. The bill aims to increase price transparency, potentially leading to informed consumer choices and market competition.",
