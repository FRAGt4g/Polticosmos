    "summary": "The Dignity for Aborted Children Act mandates specific procedures for the handling of fetal remains after an abortion. It requires abortion providers to offer patients choices for disposal (possession for interment/cremation or provider-handled disposal). Providers must ensure proper final disposition via interment or cremation within a specific timeframe (7 days), in accordance with state law. The bill also includes informed consent documentation requirements, specifies penalties for violations, mandates reporting, and defines key terms. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress summarizing abortion data and disposal methods.",
