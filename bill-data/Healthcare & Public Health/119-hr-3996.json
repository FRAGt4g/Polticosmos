    "summary": "The Medicare Transaction Fraud Prevention Act (H.R. 3996) proposes a pilot program to use a predictive risk-scoring algorithm for oversight of Medicare payments for durable medical equipment and clinical diagnostic laboratory tests. The program, lasting two years, would identify potentially fraudulent transactions by scoring them based on various factors. High-risk transactions trigger beneficiary review and potential suspension, along with enhanced communication about suspected fraud. Beneficiaries participate voluntarily with options to dispute scores and confirm transactions.",
