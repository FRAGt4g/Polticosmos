    "summary": "The Chiropractic Medicare Coverage Modernization Act of 2025 seeks to expand Medicare coverage for services provided by doctors of chiropractic. This bipartisan bill amends the Social Security Act to include all services that chiropractors are legally licensed to perform in their state, rather than the current limitation of only covering manual spinal manipulation. The purpose is to align Medicare's chiropractic coverage with that of other federal programs like the VA and private insurance. To qualify for payment for these services, chiropractors must complete an educational documentation webinar designed by the Secretary.",
