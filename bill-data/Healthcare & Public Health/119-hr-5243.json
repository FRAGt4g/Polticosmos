    "summary": "This bill, HR 5243, aims to increase data transparency for supplemental benefits within Medicare Advantage plans. It mandates MA organizations to submit enrollee-level data on these benefits to the Secretary.  This includes eligibility, benefit types, utilization, and payments. The Secretary will then make the data available for research and public use, ensuring privacy through data safeguards, starting in 2030. These changes don't affect existing information collection practices.",
