    "summary": "The Living Donor Protection Act of 2025 aims to protect living organ donors from discrimination. It prohibits insurers from denying or altering life, disability, or long-term care insurance based solely on a person's status as a living organ donor. The bill also clarifies that organ donation surgery qualifies as a serious health condition under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for both private and federal employees. Furthermore, it mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to update educational materials on the benefits and risks of living organ donation, including the impact on insurance access.",
