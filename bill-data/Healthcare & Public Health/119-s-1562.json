    "summary": "This bill, the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2025, reauthorizes the Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act. It amends the original act to extend funding for research on preterm labor and delivery, and updates the timeframe for an interagency working group.  Crucially, the bill mandates a study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on the financial costs, risk factors, and potential interventions related to premature births, including an analysis of preterm birth rates and research strategies. This study will ultimately produce a report that is submitted to several congressional committees and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.",
