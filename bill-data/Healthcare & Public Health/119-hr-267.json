    "summary": "The \"Health Care PRICE Transparency Act\" amends the Public Health Service Act and the Affordable Care Act to increase healthcare price transparency. It mandates that hospitals publicly disclose their standard charges for at least 300 shoppable services in a consumer-friendly, machine-readable format. This includes gross charges, discounted cash prices, and payer-specific negotiated rates. The bill also requires health insurers to provide members with real-time cost-sharing information through an online tool, covering in-network rates, out-of-network estimates, and prescription drug prices. The goal is to empower consumers to compare costs before receiving care.",
