    "summary": "The 'Medicaid Bump Act' aims to increase federal funding for states' Medicaid programs that provide behavioral health services, including mental health and substance use treatment. It amends the Social Security Act to provide a higher federal matching rate for increased spending on these services. The bill mandates that states use the funds to supplement, not replace, existing state funding and that funds are used to improve the delivery of behavioral health services. It also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance defining these services and mandates a report on behavioral health service payment rates and utilization.",
