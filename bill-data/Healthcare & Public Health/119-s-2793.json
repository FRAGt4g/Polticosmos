    "summary": "This bill, the Ensuring Access to Essential Providers Act of 2025, amends the Social Security Act to require Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to cover services furnished by essential community providers within their service areas. It defines essential community providers (e.g., Federally qualified health centers, hospitals serving low-income populations) and sets standards for MA plans regarding network inclusion, geographic distribution, and payment requirements. MA plans not meeting the standard must provide justification, and the Secretary can deny approval if the justification is inadequate.",
