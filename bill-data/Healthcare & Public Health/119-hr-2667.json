    "summary": "The Flexible Savings Arrangements for a Healthy Robust America Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow qualified distributions from health flexible spending arrangements (FSAs) or health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) directly to health savings accounts (HSAs) when an employee establishes coverage under a high-deductible health plan. It sets dollar limitations, modifies HSA contribution rules, ensures FSA/HRA compatibility, and requires reporting of qualified HSA distributions on W-2 forms. The changes are effective for distributions made after December 31, 2025.",
