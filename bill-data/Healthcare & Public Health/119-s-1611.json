    "summary": "The Youth Substance Use Prevention and Awareness Act aims to combat youth substance use through public service announcement (PSA) campaigns. It amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include grants for developing and implementing research-based PSA programs using age-appropriate materials across various platforms. The bill mandates the Attorney General to publish annual reports detailing grant usage, campaign specifics, research, regional messaging, and evaluation of the PSA campaigns' effectiveness in reducing youth drug use.",
