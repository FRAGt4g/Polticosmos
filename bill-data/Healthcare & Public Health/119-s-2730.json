    "summary": "The Kidney Care Access Protection Act aims to improve access to innovative treatments for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under Medicare.

The bill also ensures Medicare Advantage supports these innovative therapies. A key component addresses staffing barriers with ESRD market basket labor adjustments to improve payment accuracy.",
