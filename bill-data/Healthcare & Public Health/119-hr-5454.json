    "summary": "The Medicare Advantage Prompt Pay Act (H.R. 5454) amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to improve prompt payment requirements for Medicare Advantage organizations. It mandates that organizations pay at least 95% of clean claims within 14 days (electronic) or 30 days (non-electronic). It defines 'clean claim' and specifies interest penalties for late payments. The bill empowers the Secretary to impose civil money penalties for non-compliance and requires plans to report on their prompt payment performance, including claim processing times and interest paid. These changes apply to services furnished starting January 1, 2027.",
