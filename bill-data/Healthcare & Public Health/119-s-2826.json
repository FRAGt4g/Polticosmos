    "summary": "The 988 LGBTQ+ Youth Access Act of 2025 aims to increase support for LGBTQ+ youth seeking help from the 9-8-8 suicide prevention hotline. It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to dedicate sufficient resources, including specialized services (like the Press 3 option), for this purpose. The bill amends the Public Health Service Act to ensure funding, allocating a minimum of 9% of appropriated funds for these specialized services, addressing the disproportionately high suicide attempt rates among LGBTQ+ youth.",
