    "summary": "The Bridge to Medicaid Act of 2025 aims to improve healthcare affordability and access for low-income individuals, particularly in states that haven't expanded Medicaid. Key provisions include reducing cost-sharing under qualified health plans, establishing special enrollment periods, providing additional benefits like non-emergency medical transportation, and expanding education and outreach programs. The bill also temporarily extends health insurance premium tax credits and addresses employer shared responsibility provisions under the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, it increases the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for newly eligible individuals.",
