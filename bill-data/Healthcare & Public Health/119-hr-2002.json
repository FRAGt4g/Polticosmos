    "summary": "The Patient Matching And Transparency in Certified Health IT Act of 2025 (MATCH IT Act) aims to improve patient matching within the healthcare system to enhance interoperability and reduce medical errors and costs. The bill mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to define and standardize patient match rates, develop a minimum data set for patient matching within the United States Core Data for Interoperability, and incorporate these standards into health IT certification requirements and the Medicare program. It also establishes a voluntary bonus measure within the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program to incentivize providers meeting a high patient match rate.",
