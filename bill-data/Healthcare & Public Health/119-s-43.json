    "summary": "The Skinny Labels, Big Savings Act aims to amend US patent law to provide a safe harbor from infringement for generic drug manufacturers and biosimilar developers. This means they would have protection from lawsuits if they are seeking approval or promoting a drug/biological product using specific labeling (or 'skinny labels') that doesn't include all of the same uses covered by the original patent. This aims to increase access to affordable medicines.",
