    "summary": "The Health Care Affordability Act of 2025 (H.R. 247) seeks to expand eligibility for health insurance subsidies. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to remove the income cap (the \"subsidy cliff\") that currently prevents households earning more than 400% of the federal poverty line from receiving premium tax credits. It also modifies the calculation for subsidies, establishing a new sliding scale for how much households contribute to their premiums. For those earning over 400% of the poverty line, their contribution would be capped at 8.5% of their income. These changes would apply to taxable years after 2025.",
