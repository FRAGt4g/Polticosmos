    "summary": "The 'Responsibility in Drug Advertising Act of 2025' aims to regulate direct-to-consumer drug advertising. It prohibits such advertising for the first three years after a drug's approval, with a potential waiver in the third year if deemed beneficial to public health. The Secretary of Health would also have the authority to prohibit advertising in subsequent years based on adverse health effects. The bill mandates revised regulations within a year and clarifies that it doesn't limit existing advertising regulations, and specifies an effective date.",
