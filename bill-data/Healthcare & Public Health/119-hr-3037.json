    "summary": "The Access to Breast Cancer Diagnosis Act of 2025 mandates that group health plans and health insurance issuers eliminate cost-sharing requirements (deductibles, co-pays, etc.) for diagnostic and supplemental breast examinations. It defines these examinations, clarifies that timely prior authorization and state laws with greater protections are unaffected, and includes provisions related to grandfathered health plans and high-deductible health plans with health savings accounts. The effective date for the amendments is January 1, 2026.",
