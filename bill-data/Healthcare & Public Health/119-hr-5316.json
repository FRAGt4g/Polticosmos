    "summary": "The Drug Shortage Compounding Patient Access Act of 2025 aims to address drug shortages by amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It allows licensed pharmacists and physicians to compound drugs for urgent patient needs when a shortage exists, with specific labeling and reporting requirements. The bill also expands the definition of a drug shortage, improves reporting mechanisms for manufacturing interruptions and surges in demand, and clarifies provisions related to outsourcing facility compounding. Additionally, it revises labeling requirements for compounded drugs.",
