    "summary": "The 'No Patient Left Alone Act of 2025' aims to amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to codify patient visitation rights in hospitals. The bill mandates that hospitals establish written policies regarding visitation, informing patients of their rights, including any limitations. These policies must respect patient-designated visitors, prohibit discrimination based on protected characteristics, and ensure equal visitation privileges. The bill seeks to ensure patients can receive visitors and are aware of their visitation rights.",
