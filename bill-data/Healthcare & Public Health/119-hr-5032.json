    "summary": "The Nitazene Control Act aims to permanently schedule nitazenes, a class of potent synthetic opioids, under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. It addresses the proliferation of these drugs in the illicit market and their contribution to overdoses. The bill defines nitazenes chemically and mandates their permanent scheduling, superseding any temporary scheduling. It grants a temporary research exemption for existing researchers and authorizes the Attorney General to issue clarifying rules. The act seeks to protect public health by controlling the distribution and use of these dangerous substances.",
