    "summary": "The Insurance Fraud Accountability Act aims to reduce fraudulent enrollment in qualified health plans under the Affordable Care Act. It increases penalties for agents and brokers who provide incorrect or fraudulent information, including civil and criminal penalties. The bill also introduces consumer protections by establishing stricter verification processes for agent-assisted enrollments, requiring transparency in enrollment processes, and authorizing the regulation of field marketing organizations and third-party marketing organizations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is granted authority to oversee agent and broker compliance through audits and a list of suspended/terminated agents.",
