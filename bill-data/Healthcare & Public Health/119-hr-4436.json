    "summary": "This bill, the Cosmetic Safety for Communities of Color and Professional Salon Workers Act of 2025, addresses cosmetic safety concerns, particularly for communities of color and salon workers. It mandates research on health disparities and worker health, supports safer alternative cosmetic chemicals, and establishes two national resource centers, one on Beauty Justice and one on Salon Worker Health and Safety. The bill also requires the translation of safety data sheets, and regulates synthetic braids, including setting safety standards and warning label requirements. The bill authorizes appropriations for these initiatives and amends existing law regarding preemption to allow for state actions providing greater protection for synthetic braids.",
