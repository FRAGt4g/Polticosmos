    "summary": "The Assistance for Rural Community Hospitals Act (ARCH Act) aims to extend Medicare payments for Medicare-dependent and low-volume hospitals. It amends the Social Security Act to extend these payment methodologies and make conforming amendments, effectively extending these programs to 2031 and beyond. Furthermore, the bill mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report to Congress on Medicare rural hospital classifications, analyzing hospital classifications, overlap between them, and providing recommendations for simplification and improved financial sustainability for rural hospitals. The report should also project the effects of allowing sole community and Medicare-dependent small rural hospitals to use a 2021 cost reporting period for adjusted payments.",
