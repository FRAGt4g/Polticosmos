    "summary": "The Dental and Optometric Care Access Act of 2025 aims to improve healthcare coverage under vision and dental plans. It amends Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act, establishing new rules regarding payment amounts, duration of limited-scope plans, and restrictions on choice of laboratories. The bill allows doctors of optometry and dentistry to charge enrollees for non-covered services, sets guidelines for plan agreements, and prevents restrictions on laboratory choices. It also includes provisions for state enforcement and doctor exclusions.",
