    "summary": "The Advancing Digital Support for Mental Health Services Act mandates that covered digital advertising platforms report annually to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on their public service advertisements related to mental, behavioral, and physical healthcare. The reports must include the number, value, and specific focus of these ads, along with a description of how they meet the definition of a public service advertisement. The FTC will then summarize this information in reports to Congress. The bill defines key terms like 'covered digital advertising platform' and 'public service advertisement.'",
