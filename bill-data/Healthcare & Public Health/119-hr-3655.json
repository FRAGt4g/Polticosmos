    "summary": "The STAR Plus Scholarship Act aims to establish a scholarship program to incentivize individuals to work in substance use disorder treatment and behavioral/mental health fields in underserved areas. It amends the Public Health Service Act to create a scholarship program offering financial assistance for educational expenses in exchange for a service commitment in designated shortage areas. The bill outlines eligibility criteria, application processes, contract terms, priorities for awarding scholarships, obligated service details, breach penalties, and establishes a fund to replace lost services due to contract breaches. It also excludes the scholarship from gross income and authorizes appropriations for the program.",
