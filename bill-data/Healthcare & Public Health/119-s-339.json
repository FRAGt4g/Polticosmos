    "summary": "This bill, the 'Nancy Gardner Sewell Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act,' amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide Medicare coverage for multi-cancer early detection (MCED) screening tests. It defines MCED tests, sets coverage criteria (FDA clearance/approval, blood-based tests), and outlines payment mechanisms and limitations, including age restrictions. Conforming amendments are made to related sections of the Social Security Act. The bill emphasizes MCED tests are for concurrent cancer detection and doesn't affect coverage for other cancer screenings.",
