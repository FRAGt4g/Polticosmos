    "summary": "This bill, the \"Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening for High-risk Insured Men Act\" (PSA Screening for HIM Act), amends the Public Health Service Act to mandate that group health plans and health insurance issuers cover prostate cancer screenings without cost-sharing for men aged 40 and over who are at high risk, including African-American men and men with a family history of the disease. The bill defines \"family history\" and clarifies that other preventive health service recommendations are still active. The amendments become effective for plan years starting January 1, 2025.",
