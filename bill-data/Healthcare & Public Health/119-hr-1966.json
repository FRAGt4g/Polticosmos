    "summary": "The 'Mamas and Babies in Underserved Communities Act of 2025' aims to improve maternal health care services in underserved communities. It authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities (public or nonprofit healthcare providers) to expand and improve prenatal, postnatal (for infants), and postpartum care. The bill prioritizes entities serving minority, low-income, or medically underserved communities and includes conditions for cultural and linguistic appropriateness and limits administrative expenses. It also mandates coordination with other federal maternal health programs and defines key terms like 'medically underserved community,' 'postnatal,' and 'postpartum.' Finally, it authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2026-2030.",
