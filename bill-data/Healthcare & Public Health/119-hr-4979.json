    "summary": "The Tick Identification Pilot Program Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to states for implementing tick identification programs. These programs would allow individuals to submit tick images electronically, providing location and date information.  Qualified professionals would identify the tick species, estimate disease risk, and provide recommendations.  The bill mandates data collection on tick incidents and requires reports to Congress. The goal is to improve awareness and response to tick-borne illnesses.",
