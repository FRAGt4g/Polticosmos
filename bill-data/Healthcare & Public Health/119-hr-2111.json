    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 2111, proposes to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt the premium cigar industry from certain regulations. The bill cites findings from a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report that suggest premium cigar use poses less risk than other tobacco products. The bill defines \"premium cigar\" based on specific criteria like tobacco leaf composition, manufacturing process, and absence of additives, aligning with a narrower definition than the NASEM study. The aim is to remove premium cigars from certain federal regulations based on their perceived lower risk profile.",
