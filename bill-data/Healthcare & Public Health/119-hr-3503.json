    "summary": "The Kidney Donation Anti-Discrimination Act aims to protect living kidney donors from discrimination by life insurance providers. The bill prohibits discrimination in offering, cancellation, pricing, or coverage amounts based solely on a person's living kidney donor status, absent additional actuarial risk. It grants individuals a private right of action to sue entities that violate the act and clarifies that the law does not preempt stronger state or local protections. It defines \"life insurance policy\" and \"living kidney donor.\"",
