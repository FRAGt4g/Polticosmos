    "summary": "The Fair Pharmacies for Federal Employees Act of 2025 aims to prevent anticompetitive practices in the federal employee health benefits program. It prohibits the Office of Personnel Management from contracting with qualified carriers that own or control pharmacies or pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Furthermore, it prevents carriers from contracting with PBMs that own or control pharmacies. The bill defines key terms like 'pharmacy,' 'pharmacy benefit manager,' and 'health plan,' and clarifies that it does not limit the authority of other federal agencies. The main goal is to promote fair competition and ensure efficient healthcare delivery for federal employees.",
