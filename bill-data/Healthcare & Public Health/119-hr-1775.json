    "summary": "The 'Second Chances for Rural Hospitals Act' amends the Social Security Act to modify criteria for designating rural emergency hospitals. It expands the definition to include facilities that previously operated as critical access hospitals or subsection (d) hospitals in rural areas, and that have since ceased operations. It also adjusts payment rules for these facilities, potentially impacting reimbursement rates based on their proximity to other hospitals. The amendments are scheduled to take effect January 1, 2027.",
