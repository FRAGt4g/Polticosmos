    "summary": "The 'Medicaid VBPs for Patients Act' (S. 1637) aims to codify value-based purchasing (VBP) arrangements within the Medicaid program. It allows for multiple 'best price points' in VBP agreements, defines how 'average manufacturer price' is calculated under these arrangements, and excludes certain remuneration from average sales price calculations under Medicare. The bill also directs guidance on VBP for inpatient drugs, amends the anti-kickback statute, and mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on the impact of VBP on patient access, outcomes, and costs, with a report due by June 30, 2029.",
