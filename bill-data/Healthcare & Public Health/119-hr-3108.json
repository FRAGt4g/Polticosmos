    "summary": "The 'Rural Patient Monitoring Access Act' aims to improve access to and payment for remote patient monitoring (RPM) under Medicare.  It increases geographic indices for RPM in rural areas to ensure adequate reimbursement.  The bill mandates that RPM be provided with real-time physician or qualified healthcare professional availability and through EHR-compatible systems. It also requires data reporting to evaluate cost savings and mandates a report to Congress on the impact of RPM on Medicare savings and related expenses.",
