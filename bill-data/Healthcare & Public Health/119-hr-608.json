    "summary": "This bill, the \"COVER Now Act,\" amends the Social Security Act to create a demonstration project under Medicaid. It allows political subdivisions of states that haven't expanded Medicaid to provide medical assistance to the expansion population. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will select qualifying political subdivisions to participate. The federal government will provide funding to these subdivisions, with a decreasing federal match over time. The bill also places restrictions on states that might try to hinder the demonstration projects and specifies a timeline for implementation and reporting. The bill aims to increase healthcare access for vulnerable populations.",
