    "summary": "The 'Preventing Hospital Overbilling of Medicare Act' aims to address incorrect billing practices by off-campus hospital locations. The bill amends the Social Security Act and Public Health Service Act to promote site-neutral payments, require separate National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) for off-campus outpatient departments, and establish billing requirements for these departments. It also mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to create a model Act or regulation to address inappropriate billing practices.",
