    "summary": "The Reducing Obesity in Youth Act of 2025 aims to amend the Public Health Service Act to promote healthy eating and physical activity among children. It establishes a grant program for eligible entities to support early care and education providers, link programs to nutrition resources, monitor progress, and engage families. The Secretary of Health, through the CDC, will award 5-year grants to organizations that address childhood obesity and food insecurity in early care and education settings.  The bill also mandates a report to Congress evaluating the program's outcomes.",
