    "summary": "The Medicaid Primary Care Improvement Act aims to clarify that states can utilize direct primary care arrangements within their Medicaid programs. It explicitly allows for these arrangements, where primary care services are provided for a fixed periodic fee. The bill mandates guidance from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including stakeholder input, and requires a report to Congress analyzing state participation and the impact of these arrangements on care quality and cost.  Importantly, the bill does not alter existing state plan requirements like cost-sharing or limit medical assistance solely to these direct care models.",
