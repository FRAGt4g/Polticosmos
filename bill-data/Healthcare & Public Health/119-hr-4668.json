    "summary": "This bill, the \"End the Vaccine Carveout Act,\" aims to eliminate liability protections for vaccine manufacturers. It amends the Public Health Service Act to allow individuals to sue vaccine administrators and manufacturers for vaccine-related injuries or deaths, regardless of prior petition filings with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The bill also removes COVID-19 vaccines from the definition of covered countermeasures, effectively removing some liability protections for those vaccines. This bill addresses issues related to liability, compensation mechanisms, and the scope of manufacturer protection.",
