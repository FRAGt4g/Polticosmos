    "summary": "The Women\u2019s Health Protection Act of 2025 aims to create a federal statutory right for healthcare providers to offer and patients to receive abortion services, superseding conflicting state laws. The bill prohibits numerous restrictions on pre-viability abortions, such as specific procedure bans, telemedicine limitations, medically unnecessary in-person visits, and waiting periods. It also protects access to post-viability abortions when the patient's life or health is at risk. The Act explicitly defends the right to travel between states for care and grants enforcement power to the U.S. Attorney General as well as through a private right of action.",
