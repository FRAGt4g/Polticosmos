    "summary": "The Workers\u2019 Disability Benefits Parity Act of 2025 aims to ensure equal treatment of behavioral and physical health conditions under disability benefit plans. It amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to prohibit more restrictive limitations, exclusions, or restrictions on benefits for mental health or substance use disorder related disabilities compared to physical health conditions. It defines relevant terms, sets civil monetary penalties for violations, and mandates a study by the Secretary of Labor, particularly focusing on the cost of parity.",
