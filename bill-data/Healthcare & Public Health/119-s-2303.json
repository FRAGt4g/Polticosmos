    "summary": "This bill, the Promoting Physical Activity for Americans Act, mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish reports providing physical activity recommendations for Americans. The initial report is due by December 31, 2029, and subsequent reports every ten years. These reports will be based on scientific and medical knowledge, with considerations for subgroups like children and individuals with disabilities. Updated reports, focusing on specific populations or issues, will be published every five years. Federal agencies issuing differing recommendations must consider these guidelines, but no individual physical fitness standards are binding by federal law. The Act's focus will be to inform public and agency recommendation on physical activity.",
