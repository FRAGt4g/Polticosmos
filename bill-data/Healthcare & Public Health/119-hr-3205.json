    "summary": "This bill, the \"No Subsidies for Gender Transition Procedures Act,\" aims to restrict federal funding and tax deductions for gender transition procedures. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to deny medical expense tax deductions for these procedures, prohibits Medicaid, CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program), and Medicare funding for them, and excludes them from essential health benefits under the Affordable Care Act. The bill defines \"gender transition procedure\" broadly, outlining specific hormonal and surgical interventions, while also providing narrow exclusions for certain medical conditions.",
