    "summary": "The 'End Taxpayer Funding of Gender Experimentation Act of 2025' aims to prohibit federal funds from being used for gender transition procedures, including hormonal and surgical interventions. It defines 'gender transition' and 'gender transition procedure' extensively. The bill amends existing laws to clarify that premium credits and cost-sharing reductions under the Affordable Care Act and the small employer health insurance expense credit cannot be used for plans covering gender transition procedures. It also restricts federal facilities and employees from providing such procedures. Separate coverage using non-federal funds is permitted, and the bill outlines specific exclusions and definitions related to the topic of gender transition.",
