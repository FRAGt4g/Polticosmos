    "summary": "The 'Continuous Skilled Nursing Quality Improvement Act of 2025' aims to improve continuous skilled nursing services provided through Medicaid. It mandates the development of national quality standards, revises definitions (replacing 'private duty nursing' with 'continuous skilled nursing'), and requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to convene a working group, issue guidelines, and update existing regulations and quality measures. The bill also looks at revising the standards for home and community-based waiver services, thereby including continuous skilled nursing services.",
