    "summary": "The Medical Manufacturing, Economic Development, and Sustainability Act of 2025 (MMEDS Act of 2025) aims to boost domestic medical manufacturing, particularly in economically distressed areas. It proposes tax credits for medical manufacturers based on wages, fringe benefits, and facility property.  The bill also targets the national supply chain, and production of 'population health products' designed to protect vulnerable populations in epidemics/pandemics. Additional provisions specify definitions and guidelines related to the designation of economically distressed zones. The bill also amends the Public Health Service Act to support population-focused healthcare research and development.",
