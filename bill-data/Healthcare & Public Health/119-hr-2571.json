    "summary": "The Self-Insurance Protection Act amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to exclude certain medical stop-loss insurance from the definition of health insurance coverage. This aims to clarify the regulation of stop-loss policies, which protect self-funded group health plans from large claims, ensuring they are not unfairly restricted. The bill also specifies that ERISA preempts state laws that hinder group health plans from insuring against excessive claims losses.",
