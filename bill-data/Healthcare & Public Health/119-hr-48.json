    "summary": "The Ultrasound Informed Consent Act amends the Public Health Service Act to require abortion providers to perform an ultrasound before a woman gives informed consent for an abortion. The provider must explain the ultrasound, display the images, and describe the embryo or fetus, including its dimensions, cardiac activity, and visible features. While the woman must be offered the opportunity to view the images, she can decline to look. The bill includes an exception for medical emergencies that endanger the mother's life and establishes civil penalties for non-compliant providers, as well as a private right of action for the woman.",
