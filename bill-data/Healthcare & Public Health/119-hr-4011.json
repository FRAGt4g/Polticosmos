    "summary": "The Community Paramedicine Act of 2025 aims to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities, such as emergency medical services agencies and tribal organizations, to support community paramedicine programs in rural areas. The grants can be used for various purposes, including hiring personnel, purchasing equipment, and conducting public outreach. The bill defines community paramedicine and sets the maximum award amounts, grant periods, and administrative cost limitations. It also mandates an advisory board and reporting by grantees.",
