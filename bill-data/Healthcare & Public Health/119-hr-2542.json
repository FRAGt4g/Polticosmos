    "summary": "The 'Old Drugs, New Cures Act' aims to amend Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to change how certain \"priority research drugs\" are treated under Medicare and Medicaid programs. Specifically, it seeks to exclude drugs that are being investigated for new indications and meet certain criteria (including having been approved for at least 10 years and addressing a significant unmet medical need) from being considered line extensions when calculating manufacturer rebates. The bill also details the process for designating a drug as a 'priority research drug'.",
