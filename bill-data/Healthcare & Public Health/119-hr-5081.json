    "summary": "The Telehealth Modernization Act extends various telehealth flexibilities under Medicare. It removes geographic requirements, expands originating sites and eligible practitioners. It extends telehealth services for federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics, delays in-person requirements for mental health services, and extends audio-only services. Additionally, it extends telehealth use for hospice care recertification and acute hospital care at home waivers. The bill also includes requirements for DME claims review, a report on fraud risks in lab tests, guidance on telehealth for individuals with limited English proficiency, in-home cardiopulmonary rehabilitation flexibilities, and inclusion of virtual diabetes prevention program suppliers in the MDPP Expanded Model.",
