It outlines exceptions for specific veterinary and congressionally authorized research. The bill establishes a Federal Research Modernization Fund to support the transition to non-animal methods and mandates an animal release program for retired research animals, including a public database. It also includes penalties for violations and provisions for audits and congressional hearings.",
