It amends existing public health laws to provide grants for services, mandates research on mental health disparities, establishes best practices for health professions training, and directs the development of an outreach and education strategy. The bill also authorizes additional funding for the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities to support research and programs focused on mental health.",
