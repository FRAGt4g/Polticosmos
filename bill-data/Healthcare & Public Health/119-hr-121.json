    "summary": "Introduced as H.R. 121, the 'No Vaccine Passports Act' prohibits federal agencies from issuing vaccine passports, passes, or other standardized documentation for the purpose of certifying a U.S. citizen's COVID-19 vaccination status to third parties. The bill also forbids agencies from publishing or sharing a citizen's COVID-19 vaccination records. Furthermore, it states that proof of COVID-19 vaccination cannot be a requirement for a citizen to access Federal property, services, or congressional grounds. The prohibition applies to all agencies as defined in title 5 of the U.S. Code.",
