The bill mandates that remote monitoring services be payable for a minimum of 2 days of data collection over a 30-day period, regardless of COVID-19 status. It also requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit a report to Congress within a year, analyzing remote monitoring, recommending reimbursement models based on patient acuity and cost, and providing recommendations, while consulting with various healthcare entities and groups.",
