    "summary": "This bill, the \"Ensuring Outpatient Quality for Rural States Act,\" amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. It addresses the payment structure for hospital outpatient department services in Alaska and Hawaii. Specifically, it allows the Secretary to adjust payment amounts for these services to account for the unique challenges faced by hospitals in these states, mirroring the cost-of-living adjustments applied to non-labor costs in other contexts. The bill explicitly states that this adjustment should not be budget-neutral.",
