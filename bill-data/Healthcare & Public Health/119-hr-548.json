    "summary": "The HSA Modernization Act (H.R. 548) proposes several changes to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Key provisions include allowing certain veterans and individuals on Medicare by reason of age to contribute to HSAs, clarifying eligibility for individuals using Indian Health Services. The bill also allows Bronze and Catastrophic plans with HSAs, provides a safe harbor for mental health deductibles, permits HSAs to cover certain medical expenses incurred before account establishment, allows married couples with family coverage to divide catch-up contributions, and increases the maximum contribution limit. It also clarifies that HSA distributions can be used for qualified long-term care services.",
