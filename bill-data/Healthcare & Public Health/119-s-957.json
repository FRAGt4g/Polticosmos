    "summary": "The \"Honor Our Living Donors Act\" amends the Public Health Service Act to prevent consideration of an organ recipient's income when reimbursing living organ donors for expenses. It also removes the expectation of payments from recipients and mandates an annual report to Congress on the adequacy of funding for donor reimbursement, including the number of donors not fully reimbursed and the estimated funding needed. The bill aims to support living organ donation and ensure donors are adequately compensated.",
