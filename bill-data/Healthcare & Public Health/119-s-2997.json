    "summary": "The Right to Override Act (S. 2997) aims to protect health care professionals' independent judgment when using AI/CDSS systems. Key provisions mandate policies for covered entities (healthcare providers) regarding AI/CDSS usage, including allowing professionals to override AI outputs, providing training, and establishing AI/CDSS committees. The bill also prohibits adverse employment actions against professionals for overriding AI/CDSS outputs and offers whistleblower protections. Enforcement mechanisms include civil monetary penalties and a private right of action for those harmed by violations. The Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services are given regulatory and oversight powers. Education materials will be disseminated to both covered entities and health care professionals, while state enforcement is also authorized, with a rule of construction to preserve medical malpractice claims.",
