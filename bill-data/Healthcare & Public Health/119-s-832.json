    "summary": "This bill, the Ensuring Pathways to Innovative Cures Act of 2025 (or EPIC Act of 2025), aims to amend the Social Security Act regarding the Drug Price Negotiation Program. Specifically, it seeks to equalize the negotiation period for small-molecule and biologic drug candidates. The bill adjusts the timeframe for when manufacturers must negotiate drug prices, increasing the period before negotiation for biologic drugs, to 11 years. This change impacts regulations impacting drug pricing negotiations.",
