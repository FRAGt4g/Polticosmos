    "summary": "This bill, titled the \"Protecting Our Children from the CDC Act,\" amends the Public Health Service Act. It prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from adding any COVID-19 vaccine to the child and adolescent immunization schedule unless all clinical data on the vaccine's safety and efficacy are posted on the CDC's public website. The data must be de-identified. The bill also mandates the immediate removal of any COVID-19 vaccines currently on the schedule, though it allows for their reinstatement once the data transparency requirement is met.",
