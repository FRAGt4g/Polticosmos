    "summary": "The Protect Social Security and Medicare Act aims to safeguard benefits provided by the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It mandates a supermajority vote (two-thirds) in both the House and Senate to pass any legislation that would reduce existing benefits under these programs. An exception exists for reductions in payments to Medicare Advantage plans, provided those reductions are offset by increased payments for other purposes within Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration will determine if a provision would trigger these requirements.",
