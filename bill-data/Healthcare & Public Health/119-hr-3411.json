    "summary": "The Conscience Protection Act of 2025 aims to amend the Public Health Service Act to protect healthcare entities from discrimination if they do not participate in abortion-related services. It prohibits federal entities and recipients of federal funds from penalizing healthcare providers who object to abortion. The bill outlines the scope of protections, defines key terms, and strengthens enforcement mechanisms, including a private right of action, allowing individuals and entities to sue for violations of conscience protections. The bill also specifies that the Secretary of HHS must issue regulations to enforce conscience laws.",
