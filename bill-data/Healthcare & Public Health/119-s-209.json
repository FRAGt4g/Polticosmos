    "summary": "The 'Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act of 2025' aims to protect children from gender-transition procedures. It establishes a private right of action, allowing individuals injured by such procedures performed before the age of 18 to sue medical practitioners up to 30 years after turning 18. The bill defines gender-transition procedures, with exceptions. It also prohibits federal funding for states mandating such procedures and preserves medical providers' freedom of conscience concerning these procedures.",
