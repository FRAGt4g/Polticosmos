    "summary": "This bill, the Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Enhancement Act, amends the existing Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Act. It mandates the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to issue or update guidelines for the hygienic handling of breast milk, baby formula, and related items during security screenings. The guidelines, developed in consultation with maternal health organizations, will aim to minimize contamination risks and apply to TSA personnel and private security companies. The bill also requires the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General to audit compliance with these new requirements and assess the impact of screening technologies.",
