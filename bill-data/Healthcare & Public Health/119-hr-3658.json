    "summary": "The '911 Community Crisis Responders Act of 2025' proposes grants to states, territories, and tribal governments to establish unarmed mobile crisis response programs. These programs would dispatch trained professionals instead of law enforcement to nonviolent emergency calls related to mental health, homelessness, and substance use. The bill outlines program requirements, permissible uses of funds, reporting obligations, and definitions, emphasizing de-escalation, community-based services, and data collection to evaluate program effectiveness and reduce reliance on law enforcement.",
