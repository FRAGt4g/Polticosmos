    "summary": "The Help Ensure Lower Patient Copays Act (HELP Copays Act) aims to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The bill mandates that financial assistance from non-profit organizations and drug manufacturers counts towards an individual's deductible, coinsurance, copayment, and out-of-pocket maximums for health insurance plans. It applies this provision particularly to prescription drugs, including specialty drugs and those subject to utilization management. The amendments take effect for plan years starting January 1, 2026.",
