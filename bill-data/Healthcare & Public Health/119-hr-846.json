    "summary": "The Stop Antiabortion Disinformation Act (SAD Act) aims to prohibit deceptive advertising related to abortion services. The bill targets entities that misrepresent their services, specifically those falsely claiming to offer contraception, abortion services, or access to licensed medical personnel.  It charges the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with enforcement, including rulemaking, civil penalties, and the ability to bring civil actions. The bill is motivated by concerns about disinformation spread through 'crisis pregnancy centers' and its effects on access to reproductive healthcare.",
