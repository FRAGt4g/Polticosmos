    "summary": "This bill, the Halting the Epidemic of Addiction and Loss Act of 2025, mandates that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) broaden its references to opioid overdose reversal agents in grant programs. Specifically, it requires HHS to include any FDA-approved opioid overdose reversal drug, not just naloxone, in its regulations and guidance for programs addressing opioid misuse. It also mandates updating existing references within certain grant programs (State Opioid Response Grants and grants for priority substance use disorder prevention) to reflect this inclusivity.",
