    "summary": "The Pregnancy.Gov Act mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a public website, pregnancy.gov, providing ZIP-code based information for expecting mothers. The website will act as a clearinghouse for relevant resources, including health services, financial assistance, and mentorship opportunities. It will facilitate user feedback and potential contact for follow-up support. The bill also includes provisions for State grant programs to aggregate resources and reporting obligations to Congress. Certain entities promoting or providing abortions would be prohibited from being listed. The Act defines key terms such as 'abortion' and 'prohibited entity'.",
