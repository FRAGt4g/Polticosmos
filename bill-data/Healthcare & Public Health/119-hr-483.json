    "summary": "This bill, the \"Health Care Efficiency Through Flexibility Act,\" directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to delay the mandatory implementation of electronic Clinical Quality Metrics (eCQMs) for Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) until January 1, 2030. It establishes a pilot program starting by 2026 to test alternative digital reporting methods. The bill also mandates the development of standardized digital quality reporting standards by 2030. In the interim, ACOs can continue using existing reporting methods without penalty, and the bill requires a report to Congress on the pilot program's findings by 2028.",
