    "summary": "The Connected Maternal Online Monitoring Act (Connected MOM Act) aims to improve maternal and child health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women enrolled in State Medicaid programs. It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit a report to Congress within 18 months, identifying barriers to coverage of remote physiological monitoring devices (like pulse oximeters and blood pressure cuffs) under Medicaid and providing recommendations to address these barriers. The Secretary will update resources for State Medicaid programs, based on the report's recommendations, within 6 months of the report's submission.",
