    "summary": "The Worldwide Animal Testing Compliance and Harmonization Act of 2025 (WATCH Act) amends the Public Health Service Act to require quarterly inspections of foreign laboratories receiving federal funds for biomedical and behavioral research involving animals. These inspections, conducted by a designated authority, will assess compliance with animal welfare regulations. Laboratories in compliance will receive certification, with these certifications being publicly accessible. Non-compliant laboratories will be given an opportunity for corrective action, and persistent non-compliance may lead to suspension or revocation of funding. The Secretary of Health, in coordination with NIH and foreign authorities, will oversee the implementation and enforcement of this legislation.",
