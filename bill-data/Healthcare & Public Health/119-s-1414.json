    "summary": "The Expedited Access to Biosimilars Act aims to expedite the approval process for biosimilar biological products. The bill amends the Public Health Service Act to limit the scope of clinical studies required for biosimilar licensure. It removes the mandatory requirement for assessing immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, or comparative clinical efficacy, allowing the Secretary to decide if such studies are needed, with written justification provided to the applicant. The changes apply to applications submitted after the Act's enactment.",
