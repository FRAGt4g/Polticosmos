    "summary": "This bill, the \"Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act,\" amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit federal family planning grants from being awarded to any entity that performs abortions or provides funds to another entity that performs them. It includes exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when a physician certifies the abortion is necessary to save the woman's life from a physical danger. Hospitals are largely exempt, provided they do not fund non-hospital abortion providers. The bill also mandates annual reporting to Congress on grant recipients and the number of abortions performed under the exceptions.",
