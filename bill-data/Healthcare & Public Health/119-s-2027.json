    "summary": "The Prescription Information Modernization Act of 2025 aims to modernize how prescribing information for drugs is communicated. It allows manufacturers to provide this information digitally, with provisions for prescribers and dispensers to opt-in to paper copies. The bill mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations, design them to minimize economic impacts, and hold a public workshop. The changes apply to drugs in interstate commerce after a certain period or the implementation of final regulations.",
