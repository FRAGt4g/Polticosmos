    "summary": "The Medicare Beneficiary Co-Pay Fairness Act aims to amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. It seeks to limit the coinsurance amount for certain services provided in ambulatory surgical centers under Medicare. Specifically, if the standard coinsurance would exceed the inpatient hospital deductible for a given year, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to reduce the coinsurance to the deductible amount and reimburse the surgical center for the difference. This would apply to services furnished on or after January 1, 2026.",
