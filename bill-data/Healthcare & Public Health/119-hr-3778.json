    "summary": "This bill, the \"Preserving Emergency Access in Key Sites Act\" (PEAKS Act), aims to update the fee schedule for ambulance services provided by critical access hospitals under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. It amends existing legislation to account for mountainous terrain and secondary roads, potentially allowing certain hospitals to maintain their critical access designation even if new facilities are built nearby. The bill also directs the Secretary to create regulations for implementation.",
