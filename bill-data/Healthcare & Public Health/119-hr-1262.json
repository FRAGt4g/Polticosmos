    "summary": "The \"Give Kids a Chance Act of 2025\" primarily focuses on pediatric cancer drug development. It amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to encourage research into pediatric uses of drugs, particularly with molecularly targeted cancer treatments. The bill addresses topics like additional FDA authorities, pediatric study requirements, priority review vouchers for rare pediatric diseases, limitations on orphan drug exclusivity, programs for pediatric studies, organ procurement, and establishing an Abraham Accords Office within the FDA to facilitate international cooperation and regulatory harmonization. It includes provisions for reports to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to assess the impact and effectiveness of the proposed changes.",
