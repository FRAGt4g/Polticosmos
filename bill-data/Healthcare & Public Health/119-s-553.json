    "summary": "The Save Our Lone Emergency Services Act (SOLES Act) aims to amend the Social Security Act to provide financial relief to sole community hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii. It mandates that if payments under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system fall below 94% of reasonable costs for these hospitals, the payment will be increased by the difference. This increase won't impact copayments and will not be budget-neutral. The Secretary of HHS is required to issue regulations within six months of enactment.",
