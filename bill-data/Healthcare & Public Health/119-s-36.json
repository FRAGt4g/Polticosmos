    "summary": "The Protect Our Seniors Act aims to safeguard benefits for seniors within the Medicare and Social Security programs. The bill amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, establishing points of order in the Senate to prevent any legislation that reduces benefits under Medicare or Social Security. Furthermore, it prohibits using savings from Medicare to offset costs from other legislative provisions, with a two-thirds vote needed to waive or suspend these provisions. The bill's intention thus is to protect the funds which support elder care and medical services.",
