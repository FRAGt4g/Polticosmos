    "summary": "The Save Healthcare Workers Act aims to protect hospital personnel from violence. The bill amends existing law to criminalize the assault of hospital employees during their duties, with enhanced penalties for assaults involving dangerous weapons, bodily injury, or occurring during a public emergency. It also authorizes grants for hospitals to implement programs to reduce violence, including training, coordination with law enforcement, and security measures. The bill defines \"hospital\" broadly and includes provisions for grant applications, reporting, and funding authorization, with $25 million appropriated annually from 2025-2034.",
