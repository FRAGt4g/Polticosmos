    "summary": "This bill, the Improving Access to Advance Care Planning Act, amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to expand Medicare coverage for advance care planning services. It defines these services, outlines eligible practitioners, and mandates that the Secretary of Health and Human Services conduct outreach to inform practitioners about the new benefit. The bill also removes cost-sharing for these services, provides for telehealth improvements, and commissions a MedPAC study on the use of these services. Overall, it aims to increase access to and utilization of advance care planning within the Medicare program.",
