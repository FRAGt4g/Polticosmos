The grants are aimed at supporting doulas and midwives, particularly in states recognizing their services and providing payment for them. The bill defines eligible entities, individuals (income limits), and specific requirements for doulas and midwives including training and certification. It also appropriates $10 million for fiscal year 2026 to fund these projects, with an effective date of October 1, 2025.",
