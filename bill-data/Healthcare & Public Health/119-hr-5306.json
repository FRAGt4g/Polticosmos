    "summary": "The Gun Suicide Prevention Act of 2025 mandates that all firearms sold in the United States must be labeled with the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number (988) in both English and Spanish. The bill overrides the exclusion of firearms from the Consumer Product Safety Act to enforce this labeling requirement. Violations will be treated as violations of the Consumer Product Safety Act, with associated penalties. The Act defines 'retailer' to include firearm dealers and sets an effective date two years after enactment.",
