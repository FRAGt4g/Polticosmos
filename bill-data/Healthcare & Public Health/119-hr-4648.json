    "summary": "The Access to Fertility Treatment and Care Act mandates health insurance coverage for fertility treatments. It amends existing laws (Public Health Service Act, ERISA, IRC) to require coverage, defines fertility treatment, sets limitations on cost-sharing, and prohibits certain practices like incentives against seeking treatment. The bill also addresses federal employee health benefits, TRICARE, veteran benefits, Medicaid, and Medicare to ensure coverage across various healthcare systems for fertility treatments.",
