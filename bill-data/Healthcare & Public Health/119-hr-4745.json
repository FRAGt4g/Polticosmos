    "summary": "The 'Medicaid Bump Act' aims to increase federal financial support for state Medicaid programs that expand spending on behavioral health services (mental health and substance use). It proposes a higher federal matching rate (90%) for increased expenditures compared to a baseline period, provided states supplement rather than supplant existing funding and use the funds to improve service delivery. The bill also mandates HHS guidance on defining behavioral health services and requires reporting on state-level service provision, payment rates, and utilization.",
