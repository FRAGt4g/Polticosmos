    "summary": "The Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act of 2025 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude certain federally subsidized loan repayments for dental school faculty from gross income. The bill modifies Section 108(f)(4) of the code and mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report to assess the participation of dental providers and faculty in the Dental Faculty Development and Loan Repayment Program. The amendments apply to amounts received in taxable years after the bill is enacted.",
