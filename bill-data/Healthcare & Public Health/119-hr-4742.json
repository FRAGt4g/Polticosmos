    "summary": "The Giving Increased Variety to Ensure Milk Into the Lives of Kids Act (GIVE MILK Act) aims to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. It allows participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to choose the type of milk they receive, including whole milk, rather than being restricted to specific types. The bill highlights findings about the nutritional benefits of milk, particularly for children, and notes current dietary guidelines. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to revise regulations accordingly.",
