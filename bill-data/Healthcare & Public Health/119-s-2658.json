    "summary": "The Medication Affordability and Patent Integrity Act aims to increase transparency and integrity in the pharmaceutical industry. The bill requires drug application sponsors and holders of approved applications to share specific information with both the FDA and the USPTO, including data and communications related to patents. This measure intends to ensure that the information provided to each agency is consistent, addresses enforcement mechanisms via the FDA, and establishes a defense against patent infringement actions if required disclosures are omitted.
