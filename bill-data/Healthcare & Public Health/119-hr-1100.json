    "summary": "The 'Stop the Opioid Pill Presser and Fentanyl Act' aims to amend the Controlled Substances Act to regulate tableting and encapsulating machines and their critical parts. The bill mandates registration, serialization, and reporting requirements for manufacturers, distributors, importers, and exporters of these machines and parts. It defines critical parts, establishes a national registry, and outlines penalties for violations. The goal is to curb the illicit manufacture of controlled substances by making it harder to produce counterfeit pills.",
