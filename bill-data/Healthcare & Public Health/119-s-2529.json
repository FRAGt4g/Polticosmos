    "summary": "This bill aims to streamline the process for converting prescription drugs to over-the-counter (OTC) status, known as Rx-to-nonprescription switches. It mandates FDA guidance on application procedures, including stakeholder engagement and consideration of real-world evidence. The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report on the number of switch applications, approval timelines, and potential barriers to review. The goal is to increase clarity and predictability for companies seeking to make this change, potentially making more medications available without a prescription.",
