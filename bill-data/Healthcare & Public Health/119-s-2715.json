    "summary": "The Fair Access In Residency Act of 2025 (FAIR Act) amends the Social Security Act to require hospitals with approved medical residency training programs to submit specific information to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This data includes the number of applicants and accepted residents from osteopathic and allopathic medical schools, along with an affirmation of the hospital's non-discriminatory policy. The Secretary is mandated to publish this information on a public website. The bill aims to encourage more equitable treatment of applicants in the residency application and review process without federalizing medical education or mandating acceptance of students.",
