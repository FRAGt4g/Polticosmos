    "summary": "The 'When Minutes Count for Emergency Medical Patients Act' amends the Social Security Act to create a model for supplemental payments for ground and air ambulance services under Medicare. This model provides additional funding for specified life-saving EMS medications and blood products.  It also mandates a report from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) on emergency medical services payment, evaluations of EMS medical directors and professionals, and recommendations for quality assurance. Finally, it requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue guidance on hospital 'wall time' and report to Congress on its impact.",
