    "summary": "The 'Humane and Existing Alternatives in Research and Testing Sciences Act of 2025' (HEARTS Act) aims to prioritize and incentivize the use of non-animal methods in research and testing funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It mandates the establishment of the National Center for Alternatives to Animals in Research and Testing to promote and fund these alternatives. The bill also requires reporting on animal usage by research entities, establishes review processes, and seeks to reduce animal use through enhanced oversight and incentives, focusing on human-relevant models and data transparency.",
