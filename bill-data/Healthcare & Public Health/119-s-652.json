    "summary": "The 'Protecting Patients from Deceptive Drug Ads Act' aims to regulate communications regarding prescription drugs, particularly on social media. It introduces civil penalties for influencers and healthcare providers who make false or misleading claims about drugs, or fail to include necessary safety information. The bill also mandates guidance from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, updates regulations for telehealth providers, requires reporting of payments related to drug promotion, and authorizes market surveillance of prescription drug advertising by the FDA. The act also includes funding for the FDA to carry out these activities.",
