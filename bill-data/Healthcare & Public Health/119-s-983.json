    "summary": "The Hearing Device Coverage Clarification Act aims to clarify that implanted active middle ear hearing devices qualify as prosthetics under Medicare and are therefore not subject to the hearing aid coverage exclusion. The bill directs the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator to issue this clarification within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The bill also defines 'prosthetic' by referring to existing regulations.",
