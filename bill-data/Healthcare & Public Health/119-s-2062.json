    "summary": "The 'Rolling Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient and Drug Reserve Act' (RAPID Reserve Act) aims to bolster U.S. drug supply chain resilience. It authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to award contracts and cooperative agreements to eligible entities for maintaining reserves of critical drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). These reserves are to be regularly replenished and may be utilized in public health emergencies. The bill specifies requirements for eligible entities, including domestic manufacturing considerations, and directs the Secretary to issue guidance and report to Congress. It also authorizes $500 million in appropriations for fiscal year 2026.",
