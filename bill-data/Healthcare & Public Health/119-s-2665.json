    "summary": "The Drug Shortage Prevention Act of 2025 aims to address drug shortages by amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It mandates that manufacturers of critical drugs notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services of potential disruptions in drug supply, including permanent discontinuances, interruptions in manufacturing, or increased demand. The bill specifies the required information for notification, including the source of active pharmaceutical ingredients and expected duration of interruptions. It also updates reporting requirements on drug supply chains, requiring more frequent reporting and information on suppliers.",
