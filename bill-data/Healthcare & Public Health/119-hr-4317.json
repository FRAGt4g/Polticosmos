    "summary": "The Pharmacy Benefit Manager Reform Act of 2025 aims to increase pharmacy access and choice for Medicare beneficiaries. It mandates that PDP sponsors allow any willing pharmacy meeting contract terms to participate. The bill establishes new standards for contract terms, requires reports on pharmacy reimbursement trends, defines 'essential retail pharmacies,' and provides for enforcement of contract standards. It also addresses pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) accountability, transparency, and reporting requirements, along with audits. Finally, the bill includes provisions related to Medicaid payment structures and PBM transparency to prevent abusive spread pricing.",
