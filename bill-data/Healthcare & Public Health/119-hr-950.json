    "summary": "The 'Saving Seniors Money on Prescriptions Act' aims to increase transparency and accountability in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. It mandates pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to provide detailed reports to PDP sponsors and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. These reports must include data on drug costs, rebates, dispensing channels, and PBM/affiliate relationships. The bill also requires audits of PBMs and includes a GAO study on reporting requirements to streamline and reduce burden. The goal is to lower drug costs for seniors by increasing visibility into PBM practices.",
