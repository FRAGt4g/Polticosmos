    "summary": "The 'Helping Communities with Better Support Act' aims to increase transparency and expand coverage options for home and community-based services (HCBS) under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. It mandates the collection and public availability of data on HCBS waiver programs, including wait times, service types, and utilization rates. It also allows states to provide limited HCBS coverage under an interim care plan before a formal plan of care is finalized. The bill focuses on improving access to and oversight of HCBS for individuals needing long-term care.",
