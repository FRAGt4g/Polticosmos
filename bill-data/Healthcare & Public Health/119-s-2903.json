    "summary": "The Safe Step Act amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to mandate a clear and transparent exceptions process for medication step therapy protocols used by group health plans and insurance issuers. The bill outlines circumstances for exception approval, including when treatments have been ineffective, cause adverse reactions, or prevent functional ability. It also specifies requirements for the exception process, including timing for determinations, duration of grants, and reporting to the Secretary of Labor on exception requests. The act aims to ensure patients can access necessary medications without unnecessary delays.",
