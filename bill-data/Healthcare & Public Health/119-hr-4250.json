    "summary": "This bill, the \"Save our Lone Emergency Services Act\" (SOLES Act), aims to amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide increased payments to sole community hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS). The bill ensures that these hospitals receive at least 94% of their reasonable costs for covered outpatient services. It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations within six months of enactment and specifies that these additional payments won't be made in a budget-neutral manner.",
