The bill prohibits hiding pricing information from online searches, introduces civil monetary penalties for non-compliance based on hospital bed count, and requires the Secretary to publish a list of non-compliant hospitals. The bill seeks to hold hospitals accountable and increase price transparency for healthcare consumers.",
