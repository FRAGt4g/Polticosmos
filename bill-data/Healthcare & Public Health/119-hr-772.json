    "summary": "The Rural ER Access Act aims to revise Medicare regulations to remove the 35-mile radius requirement for off-campus healthcare facilities seeking provider-based status. This bill, introduced in the House of Representatives by Mr. Green of Tennessee, directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to change the existing regulations to allow these facilities to be located further from hospitals and critical access hospitals, potentially increasing healthcare access in rural areas.",
