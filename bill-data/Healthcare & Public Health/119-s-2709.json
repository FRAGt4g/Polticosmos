    "summary": "The Telehealth Modernization Act extends various telehealth flexibilities under Medicare. Key provisions include extending geographic and originating site requirements, expanding eligible practitioners, extending telehealth services for Federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics, delaying in-person requirements for mental health services, extending audio-only telehealth, and extending telehealth use for hospice care recertification. The bill also addresses program integrity for durable medical equipment, requires guidance on telehealth for individuals with limited English proficiency, allows in-home cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, and includes virtual diabetes prevention program suppliers in the MDPP Expanded Model. It also calls for a study and report on acute hospital care at home waiver flexibilities.",
