    "summary": "This bill, the Scientific EXPERT Act of 2025, aims to improve drug development for rare diseases. It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a process for externally-led, science-focused drug development meetings (EL-SFDD meetings). These meetings will involve medical experts, drug sponsors, and others to discuss scientific challenges, identify development opportunities, and align on drug development approaches. The Reagan-Udall Foundation will convene these meetings, and the FDA will incorporate meeting input into drug approval decisions. The bill also includes provisions for post-meeting reports and annual reporting to Congress. Funding is authorized for the program.",
