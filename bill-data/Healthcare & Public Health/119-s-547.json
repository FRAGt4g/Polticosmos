    "summary": "The Train More Nurses Act, introduced in the Senate, mandates the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Labor to review grant programs that support the nursing workforce. The bill requires a report to Congress within a year, offering recommendations to improve these programs, with specific focus on increasing nurse faculty (particularly in underserved areas), creating pathways for experienced nurses to become faculty, and encouraging/increasing the nursing pipeline for licensed practical nurses. The bill's ultimate aim is to address potential nursing shortages in the future.",
