    "summary": "The Stephen Hacala Poppy Seed Safety Act aims to regulate the sale of poppy seeds in interstate commerce due to contamination with opium alkaloids. The bill, spurred by deaths and health concerns related to contaminated poppy seeds, directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish permissible levels of morphine, codeine and other compounds in poppy seeds. Seeds exceeding these thresholds will be considered adulterated and prohibited. The bill clarifies that contaminated poppy seeds remain subject to the Controlled Substances Act.",
