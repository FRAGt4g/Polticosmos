    "summary": "The Combating Illicit Xylazine Act aims to address the misuse of xylazine, a substance used in veterinary medicine, by adding it to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act, thus regulating its distribution and use. The bill defines xylazine, amends the definition of \"ultimate user\" to restrict its use, and mandates reporting on xylazine's prevalence and trafficking. It also includes provisions for labeling, practitioner registration, and manufacturer transition regarding xylazine. Finally, it directs the Sentencing Commission to review sentencing guidelines for xylazine-related offenses.",
