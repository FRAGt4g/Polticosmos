    "summary": "The 'Supporting Healthy Moms and Babies Act' aims to prevent cost-sharing requirements for essential healthcare services related to pregnancy and childbirth. It mandates that group health plans and insurance issuers cover prenatal, childbirth, neonatal, perinatal, and postpartum care, aligning with the coverage provided by qualified health plans under the Affordable Care Act. The bill explicitly prohibits cost-sharing for these services, including ultrasounds, miscarriage care, delivery services, and postpartum behavioral health services.",
