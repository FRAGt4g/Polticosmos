It mandates that upon request, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office determine if proposed healthcare legislation would lead to net budget outlay reductions in the long term through preventive healthcare. If so, the Director must include an estimate of these savings in budget projections, which are supplementary and not used for budget compliance. The bill defines \u201cpreventive health care\u201d and specifies the budgetary outyears considered.",
