    "summary": "The Maximizing Opioid Recovery Emergency Savings Act (MORE Savings Act) aims to improve access to opioid addiction treatment and recovery services.  It mandates Medicare coverage with no cost-sharing for evidence-based treatments, behavioral health services, and recovery support services (e.g., peer counseling and transportation). It also requires group health plans (under PHS, ERISA, and IRC) to cover opioid treatments without cost-sharing. Furthermore, it enhances the federal match for medication-assisted treatment and recovery support services under Medicaid.",
