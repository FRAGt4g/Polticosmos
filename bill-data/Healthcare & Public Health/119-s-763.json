    "summary": "The Telehealth Expansion Act of 2025 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The bill seeks to permanently extend the exemption for telehealth services from specific high-deductible health plan rules. It specifies that a plan won't be disqualified as a high-deductible health plan if it lacks a deductible for telehealth and remote care. The amendments are slated to take effect for plan years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
