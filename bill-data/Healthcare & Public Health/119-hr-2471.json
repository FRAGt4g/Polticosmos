    "summary": "The 'Right Drug Dose Now Act of 2025' aims to improve patient safety and healthcare through the use of pharmacogenomics. The bill mandates updates to the National Action Plan for Adverse Drug Event Prevention, focusing on advancements in drug-gene interactions and the role of pharmacogenetic testing. It requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue guidance for healthcare professionals on pharmacogenomic testing and aims to improve electronic health record (EHR) systems to incorporate and utilize this information, also streamlining adverse event reporting. The bill also calls for a GAO study on including drug-gene interaction information on drug labels and sets deadlines for reports and updates related to EHR system improvements.",
