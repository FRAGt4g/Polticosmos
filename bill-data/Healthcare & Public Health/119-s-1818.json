    "summary": "The Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2025 aims to lower prescription drug prices by ending government-granted monopolies for manufacturers charging excessively high prices. It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to review brand-name drugs annually, comparing their prices to those in reference countries (Canada, UK, Germany, France, Japan) and considering other factors. Drugs deemed excessively priced will lose exclusivity, allowing open licenses for generic and biosimilar production. Manufacturers must report pricing and development costs. The bill includes penalties for non-compliance and establishes a public database.",
