    "summary": "This bill, the \"Epinephrine\u2019s Pharma Inflated Price Ends Now Act\" (EPIPEN Act), aims to reduce the cost of epinephrine delivery systems. It amends the Public Health Service Act, ERISA, and the Internal Revenue Code to mandate that group health plans and health insurance issuers cover epinephrine delivery systems without deductibles and with cost sharing capped at $60 per package of two systems.  It also clarifies that out-of-network providers are not necessarily covered. The amendments will take effect from January 1, 2026.",
