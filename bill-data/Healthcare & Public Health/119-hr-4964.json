    "summary": "The Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act aims to prohibit transporting minors across state lines with the intent of obtaining an abortion, circumventing parental involvement laws. It introduces new sections to Title 18 of the United States Code, establishing penalties for those who facilitate such actions and requiring physicians to notify parents before performing abortions on minors who are residents of another state.  The bill includes exceptions, definitions, and provisions for civil actions, as well as a severability clause. The bill also defines 'abortion' and other key terms.",
