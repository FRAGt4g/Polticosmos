    "summary": "The Empowering Patient Choice of Medical Care Act (H.R. 3021) aims to eliminate the inpatient-only service list maintained by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Starting January 1, 2026, the Secretary can no longer solely base the determination of whether a service can be furnished as outpatient on the fact that it may only safely be furnished in an inpatient setting. This bill seeks to expand patient choice by allowing certain services to be performed in outpatient facilities.",
