It establishes a reinsurance program to lower premiums for off-Exchange plans, funded through appropriations. The bill also modifies rules for single risk pools, removing age premium variation limitations for certain plans while maintaining them for qualified health plans. Furthermore, it mandates that healthcare providers disclose lower prices to patients and allows individuals to apply out-of-network costs to deductibles under certain conditions.",
