    "summary": "The Restroom Access Act of 2025 mandates that retail establishments with non-public restrooms allow customers with eligible medical conditions (e.g., IBD, ostomy devices, pregnancy) access to those restrooms during business hours. Customers must present an identification card (created by the Secretary of Labor), provided that two employees are present, access doesn't pose a health/safety risk, and no public restroom is available. The bill defines key terms like \"customer,\" \"eligible medical condition,\" \"medical professional,\" and \"retail establishment.\"",
