    "summary": "This bill, the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act, aims to prevent brand-name drug companies from compensating generic drug companies to delay market entry of generic drugs and biosimilars. It amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to treat such agreements as unfair competition, establishes presumptions of anticompetitive effects, and provides for civil penalties. The bill also requires certification of such agreements and includes a report on potential exclusions. The ultimate goal is to increase competition in the pharmaceutical market, lower drug costs, and benefit consumers.",
