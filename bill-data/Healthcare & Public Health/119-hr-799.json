    "summary": "The Parental Notification and Intervention Act of 2025 mandates parental notification and a 96-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed on an unemancipated minor. It allows parents to seek a federal court injunction to prevent the abortion. Exceptions exist for medical emergencies. The bill defines \"parent\" to include legal guardians and explicitly states that it does not preempt stricter state laws. Violations can result in fines and imprisonment.",
