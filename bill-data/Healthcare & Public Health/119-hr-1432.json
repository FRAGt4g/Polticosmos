    "summary": "This bill, known as the \"Let Injured Americans Be Legally Empowered Act\" (LIABLE Act), aims to remove federal immunity and liability limitations for manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines. It specifies that no federal law can protect vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits related to injuries caused by their vaccines. Individuals can still seek compensation through existing programs like the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The bill defines \"COVID-19 vaccine\" and states its retroactive applicability.",
