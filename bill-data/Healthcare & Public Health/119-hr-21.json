    "summary": "This bill, titled the \"Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,\" aims to protect infants who survive an abortion or attempted abortion. It would require healthcare practitioners to provide the same degree of professional care to such an infant as they would to any other child born at the same gestational age, and to ensure the infant is immediately hospitalized. The bill establishes criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment up to five years, for non-compliance. It also creates a civil cause of action for the mother against the violating practitioner and protects the mother from prosecution under this act.",
