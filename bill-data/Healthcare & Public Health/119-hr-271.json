    "summary": "This bill, the \"Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2025,\" imposes a one-year moratorium on federal funding to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, its affiliates, and clinics. The funding ban would be lifted only if they certify they will not perform abortions or fund entities that do during this period. Exceptions are made for abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. The bill asserts that overall funding for women's health will not be reduced, and it appropriates an additional $235 million to community health centers to provide these services.",
