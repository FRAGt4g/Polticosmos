    "summary": "This bill, the Responsibility in Drug Advertising Act of 2025, amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to restrict direct-to-consumer drug advertising. It prohibits such advertising for the first three years after a drug's approval, with a waiver possibility in the third year. The Secretary of Health can also prohibit advertising in subsequent years if post-approval studies reveal significant adverse health effects. The Secretary is mandated to revise drug advertisement regulations within a year and clarifies the scope of the new rules, with the effective date applying to drugs approved after the enactment of the law.",
