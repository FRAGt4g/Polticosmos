    "summary": "This bill, the Medicare Transaction Fraud Prevention Act, proposes a pilot program to use predictive risk-scoring algorithms to oversee Medicare payments for durable medical equipment and clinical diagnostic laboratory tests. The program will identify and flag potentially fraudulent transactions based on risk scores, allowing for review, beneficiary confirmation, and potential suspension of payments. It emphasizes beneficiary participation, collaboration with industry, and safeguards including human review and communication of the process. The program is slated for two years, beginning no later than January 1, 2026.",
