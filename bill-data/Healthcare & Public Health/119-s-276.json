    "summary": "The Personalized Care Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code to expand and improve health savings accounts (HSAs). It broadens HSA eligibility, increases contribution limits significantly, allows HSA funds to be used for health plan premiums, clarifies the treatment of medical care service arrangements, and restores a lower penalty for nonqualified HSA distributions. Additionally, it addresses the treatment of health care sharing ministries, treating fees paid to such ministries and periodic provider fees as medical expenses.",
