    "summary": "This bill, the Rural Hospital Closure Relief Act of 2025, aims to amend the Social Security Act to provide relief to struggling rural hospitals. Specifically, it allows states to waive the 35-mile rule for designating Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs), opening the door for more rural facilities to receive this designation and associated financial benefits. The bill outlines criteria for eligible hospitals, including financial and geographic considerations, and establishes limitations on the number of CAH designations. It also mandates studies by the Comptroller General and MedPAC to assess the impact of the changes and payment systems for rural hospitals, with the program sunsetting after nine years.",
