    "summary": "The Dignity for Aborted Children Act mandates specific procedures for the handling of fetal remains after an abortion. It requires abortion providers to offer patients options for disposal (patient possession or provider responsibility), mandates informed consent, and outlines provider disposal requirements (interment or cremation within 7 days). Penalties are specified for violations, along with annual reporting requirements for providers and the Secretary of Health. The Act also defines key terms, including 'abortion provider' and 'human fetal tissue'.",
