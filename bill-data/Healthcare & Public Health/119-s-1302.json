    "summary": "This bill, the 'Increasing Transparency in Generic Drug Applications Act', aims to increase transparency in the generic drug approval process. It amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to mandate the Secretary of Health and Human Services to inform applicants of generic drugs whether their drug is qualitatively and quantitatively the same as the listed drug. If not, the Secretary must identify the differing ingredients. The bill also requires the Secretary to issue guidance on how this determination will be made. The new rules apply immediately upon the bill's enactment.",
