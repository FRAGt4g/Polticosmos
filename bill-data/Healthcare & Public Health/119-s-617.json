    "summary": "The 'Overcoming Prevalent Inadequacies in Overdose Information Data Sets Act' (OPIOIDS Act) aims to combat the opioid crisis. The bill authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to states, territories, and localities for improved data collection and surveillance on opioid-related overdoses. It also provides grants to local law enforcement for training, system upgrades in forensic labs, and tracing drug-related criminal activity. The bill mandates reporting to the National Forensic Laboratory Information System and directs the DEA to develop uniform reporting standards and submit a budget line item for the Fentanyl Signature Profiling Program.",
