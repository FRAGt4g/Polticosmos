    "summary": "The Safe Step Act amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to mandate a clear and transparent exceptions process for medication step therapy protocols used by group health plans and health insurance issuers. This process allows patients and prescribers to request exemptions, outlining specific circumstances for approval, such as ineffectiveness of prior treatments, potential for severe consequences from delay, contraindications, or adverse reactions. The bill also specifies required timelines for exception determinations, reporting requirements for plans and issuers, and a reporting obligation for the Secretary to Congress. The effective date is tied to a six-month window after enactment, with associated rulemaking.",
