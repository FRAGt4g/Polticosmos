    "summary": "The Charlotte Woodward Organ Transplant Discrimination Prevention Act prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in organ transplant cases. It mandates that covered entities (healthcare providers) cannot deny transplants or related services based solely on disability. The bill defines various terms like \"qualified individual,\" \"covered entity,\" and \"reasonable modifications.\" It allows for consideration of a disability's medical significance after an individualized evaluation. The bill also specifies that failure to provide auxiliary aids and services cannot be a basis for denial, unless it fundamentally alters the procedure or creates an undue burden. Finally, the act outlines enforcement mechanisms and its relationship to existing laws.",
