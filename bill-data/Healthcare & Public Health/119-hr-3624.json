    "summary": "The Improving Mental Health Access for Students Act mandates that institutions of higher education include suicide prevention contact information on student identification cards. The bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965, requiring schools that issue ID cards to include the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, Crisis Text Line, and campus mental health center contact information. Schools without ID cards must publish this information on their websites. The amendment would take effect one year after the bill's enactment.",
