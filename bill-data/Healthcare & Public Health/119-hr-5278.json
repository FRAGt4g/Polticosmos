    "summary": "The Affordable Inhalers and Nebulizers Act of 2025 aims to reduce patient cost-sharing for prescription inhaler products used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The bill mandates that group health plans and insurance issuers provide benefits for specified inhaler products without deductibles and with a cost-sharing maximum of $15 per 30-day supply. It amends the Public Health Service Act, the Internal Revenue Code, and ERISA to implement these changes. It also addresses Medicare Part B and D coverage and establishes a payment program for uninsured individuals to access these medications.",
