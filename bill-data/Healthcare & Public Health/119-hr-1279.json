    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 1279, amends Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) to establish a community engagement requirement for certain Medicaid recipients. It proposes that individuals, not falling under specific exemptions (e.g., age, disability, pregnancy), must meet the requirement, such as working a certain number of hours, performing community service, or participating in a work program, to continue receiving federal funds for their medical assistance. States can also choose to disenroll individuals who do not meet these requirements.",
