    "summary": "The Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act of 2025 aims to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow the importation of affordable and safe prescription drugs from approved countries (initially Canada, the UK, EU member states, and Switzerland) by wholesale distributors, pharmacies, and individuals. The bill outlines criteria for certified foreign sellers, sets labeling requirements, and addresses drug testing, enforcement discretion, and reporting. It seeks to lower drug costs for Americans by leveraging international markets while maintaining safety standards.",
