    "summary": "The Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act aims to increase the number of employment-based immigrant visas for professional nurses and physicians by recapturing unused visas from previous fiscal years (1992-2024). It sets limitations on the number of visas available (up to 40,000) and reserves a portion for nurses (25,000) and physicians (15,000). The bill also includes provisions for premium processing and expedited processing of applications and requires attestation that the hiring of the alien will not displace a U.S. worker.",
