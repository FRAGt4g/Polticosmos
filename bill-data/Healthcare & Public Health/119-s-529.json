    "summary": "The Capping Prescription Costs Act of 2025 aims to limit out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs. The bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  It mandates that for plan years beginning in 2026, cost-sharing for prescription drugs cannot exceed $2,000 per individual or $4,000 per family, with increases tied to the Consumer Price Index in subsequent years. The act would apply to qualified and group health plans.",
