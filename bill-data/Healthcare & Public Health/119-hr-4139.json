    "summary": "The 'Cutting Copays Act' aims to amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, specifically focusing on Medicare Part D cost-sharing reductions for low-income individuals. The bill proposes adjustments to copayment amounts for prescription drugs, differentiating between generic and other drugs and introducing a phase-in approach based on plan years. The proposed changes would reduce copays for some drugs, starting in 2026, and adjust them annually based on the consumer price index.",
