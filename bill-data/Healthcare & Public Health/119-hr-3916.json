    "summary": "The 'My Body, My Data Act of 2025' aims to protect the privacy of personal reproductive and sexual health information. It restricts how regulated entities can collect, retain, use, and disclose this data, mandating minimization of access and requiring mechanisms for individuals to access, correct, and delete their information. It also mandates a clear privacy policy, prohibits retaliation for exercising rights under the act, and provides for enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and individuals. The bill defines key terms like 'regulated entity' and 'personal reproductive or sexual health information'.",
