    "summary": "The \"Healthy Technology Act of 2025\" (H.R. 238) amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to be legally recognized as \"practitioners\" who can prescribe drugs. To qualify, an AI or ML system must first be authorized to prescribe by the relevant state law and must also be approved, cleared, or authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This creates a legal pathway for FDA-approved and state-sanctioned AI to be integrated into the prescription process under federal and state oversight.",
