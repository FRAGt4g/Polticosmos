    "summary": "This bill, the 'No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2025,' seeks to prohibit the use of any federal funds for abortions or for health insurance plans covering them. The prohibition applies government-wide but includes exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. The legislation amends the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to disallow tax credits for health plans that cover abortion. It also mandates that insurance plans under the ACA must prominently disclose their abortion coverage and any associated surcharges in all marketing and enrollment materials.",
