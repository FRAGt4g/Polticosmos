    "summary": "The Health Coverage Choice Act (H.R. 90) proposes to amend the Public Health Service Act by establishing a federal definition for 'short-term limited duration insurance.' This bill defines these plans as having an initial contract of less than 12 months, with the possibility of renewal or extension for a total duration of up to three years. By doing so, the act aims to standardize this type of health coverage, which is typically not subject to the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, offering a different coverage option for consumers.",
