It mandates that RPM providers can respond to data anomalies with clinical support, transmit data to electronic health records, and report data to evaluate cost savings. The bill also includes a practice expense index floor and requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress on the cost savings generated by RPM and associated expenses.",
