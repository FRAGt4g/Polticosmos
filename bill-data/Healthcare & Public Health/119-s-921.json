    "summary": "This bill, \"Tyler's Law,\" directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to study and issue guidance on fentanyl testing in hospital emergency departments. The study will assess the frequency, costs, benefits, risks, and patient impact of such testing. The resulting guidance will address whether routine fentanyl testing should be implemented, how hospitals can ensure clinicians are informed about substances tested for, and the effects of testing on future overdose risk and health outcomes. The goal is to address the opioid crisis through improved patient care and information.",
