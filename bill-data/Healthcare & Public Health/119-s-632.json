    "summary": "The IHS Workforce Parity Act of 2025 amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to allow Indian Health Service scholarship and loan recipients more flexibility in fulfilling their service obligations. Specifically, it permits them to meet their obligations through half-time clinical practice, provided they agree to double the required service period. The bill also specifies how damages for breach of contract will be calculated when service is completed on a half-time basis.",
