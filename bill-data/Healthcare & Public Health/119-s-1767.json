    "summary": "The Physician and Patient Safety Act aims to protect physicians' due process rights. It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create regulations ensuring physicians with hospital staff privileges receive a fair hearing and appellate review before any termination, restriction, or reduction of their professional activities or privileges. The regulations must prevent waiver of rights through contracts, ensure confidentiality (unless patient safety is threatened), and take effect within 18 months of enactment.",
