    "summary": "The Drug-price Transparency for Consumers Act of 2025 mandates that direct-to-consumer advertisements for prescription drugs and biological products disclose pricing information, specifically the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) for a 30-day supply. This aims to improve consumer awareness of drug costs, promoting informed purchasing decisions and potentially increasing market competition. The bill also tasks the Secretary with creating regulations and outlines potential penalties for non-compliance.",
