    "summary": "The 'Surveilling Effluent Water for Epidemic Response Act' (SEWER Act) amends the Public Health Service Act to enhance the National Wastewater Surveillance System. It mandates the Secretary, through the CDC, to expand monitoring of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater for public health emergency preparedness. The bill authorizes $150 million annually from 2026-2030 for these activities, while clarifying that wastewater utilities are not compelled to comply with surveillance requests.",
