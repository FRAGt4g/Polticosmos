    "summary": "The Access to Family Building Act aims to protect access to assisted reproductive technology (ART) and related healthcare services. It prohibits limitations on ART access that are more burdensome than those on comparable medical procedures, do not advance reproductive health, or unduly restrict access. The bill grants individuals a statutory right to ART, healthcare providers the right to provide it, and insurance providers the right to cover it. The Attorney General and affected individuals can initiate civil actions against those violating the act, and the court can provide equitable relief. The bill preempts conflicting federal and state laws, and directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create regulations to implement it.",
