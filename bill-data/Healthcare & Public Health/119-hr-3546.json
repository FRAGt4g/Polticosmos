    "summary": "The Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2025 aims to lower prescription drug prices by ending monopolies for brand-name drugs deemed excessively priced. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will determine excessive pricing, considering international reference prices and other factors. If a drug's price is excessive, government-granted exclusivities are waived, and open, non-exclusive licenses are granted, allowing competition.  The bill also mandates a public database of drug prices and manufacturer reporting requirements.",
