    "summary": "The Charlotte Woodward Organ Transplant Discrimination Prevention Act prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in organ transplant cases. It defines key terms like \"qualified individual,\" \"covered entity,\" and \"reasonable modifications.\" The bill prevents denying organ transplants or related services based solely on disability and requires covered entities to make reasonable accommodations unless they fundamentally alter the nature of services. It also ensures access to auxiliary aids and services and clarifies that individuals with adequate support networks shouldn't be penalized. Enforcement is through the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services.",
