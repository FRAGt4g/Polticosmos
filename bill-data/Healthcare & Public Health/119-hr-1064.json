    "summary": "This bill, the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act, amends the Controlled Substances Act to classify fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I controlled substances. It defines fentanyl-related substances based on structural modifications of fentanyl and specifies penalties. The bill aims to address the opioid crisis by treating fentanyl-related substances as analogues of fentanyl, removing the requirement to prove they meet the definition of a controlled substance analogue.",
