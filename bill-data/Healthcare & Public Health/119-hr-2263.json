    "summary": "The Telehealth Coverage Act of 2025 aims to expand and make permanent certain telehealth flexibilities within the Medicare program. The bill removes deadlines on existing telehealth provisions, allowing for broader access to services including expanding eligible practitioners and services offered by rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers. It addresses use of audio-only technology, elimination of in-person requirements for certain services, requires modifiers for telehealth services in specific instances, extends home care waivers, mandates guidance on providing telehealth to those with limited English proficiency, and introduces other provisions such as in-home cardiopulmonary rehabilitation flexibilities, and inclusion of virtual diabetes prevention programs in the MDPP. It also provides for medication-induced movement disorder outreach and education.",
