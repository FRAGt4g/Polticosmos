    "summary": "The 'Tech to Save Moms Act' aims to improve maternal health outcomes through technology. It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants for telehealth in maternity care (e.g., screening, monitoring), expanding technology-enabled collaborative learning, and promoting digital tools to reduce disparities. The bill includes provisions for training, evaluation, reporting, and funding for these initiatives. It also calls for a National Academies study on technology and patient monitoring in maternity care, including bias and best practices.",
