    "summary": "The Stephen Hacala Poppy Seed Safety Act aims to prevent deaths and health issues related to contaminated poppy seeds. It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish permissible levels of morphine, codeine and other alkaloid compounds in poppy seeds. Seeds exceeding these thresholds will be deemed adulterated and prohibited in interstate commerce, but the bill specifically states that contaminated poppy seeds will not be exempted from regulation under the Controlled Substances Act.",
