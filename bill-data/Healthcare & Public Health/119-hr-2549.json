    "summary": "The Fire Island AIDS Memorial Act (H.R. 2549) authorizes the Pines Foundation to establish and maintain a memorial at the Fire Island National Seashore in New York to honor residents who died from AIDS. The bill aims to educate future generations about the AIDS epidemic's impact on Fire Island communities. Federal funds cannot be used for the memorial's development, but the Director of the National Park Service can accept non-federal contributions. The memorial's location is proposed along the walkway between Fire Island Pines and Cherry Grove, and the Director must approve the final design.",
