    "summary": "The 'Honor Our Living Donors Act' amends the Public Health Service Act to ensure that the income of organ recipients is not considered when providing reimbursement to living organ donors for their expenses. It also eliminates the expectation of payments by recipients and mandates an annual report detailing the funding adequacy of the grant program for donor reimbursements, including estimates of unmet expenses and the necessary funding to cover them. The bill aims to improve the support system for living organ donors.",
