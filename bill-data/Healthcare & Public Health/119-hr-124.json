    "summary": "The 'Byron Nash Renal Medullary Carcinoma Awareness Act of 2023' (H.R. 124) amends the Social Security Act to promote awareness of a rare kidney cancer, renal medullary carcinoma (RMC), which is strongly linked to sickle cell disease. The bill provides federal incentives for educating Medicaid recipients who have sickle cell disease about the risks of RMC. By adding RMC to an existing list of conditions for which educational outreach is incentivized, the act aims to improve early detection and knowledge within this specific high-risk population, leveraging the Medicaid program to disseminate critical health information.",
