    "summary": "The Drug Competition Enhancement Act aims to prohibit \"product hopping,\" a practice where pharmaceutical companies switch patients from a branded drug to a follow-on product to maintain market exclusivity and impede competition from generic or biosimilar drugs. The bill amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to define product hopping, create a prima facie case for unfair competition, provide for justifications from manufacturers, and grant the Federal Trade Commission enforcement powers, including disgorgement and restitution. The bill doesn't affect antitrust laws.",
