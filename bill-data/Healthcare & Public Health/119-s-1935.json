    "summary": "This bill, the Expanding Access to Palliative Care Act (S. 1935), amends the Social Security Act to test a community-based palliative care model. This model aims to provide care coordination for high-risk Medicare beneficiaries with serious illnesses, focusing on improving outcomes, reducing hospitalizations, and replacing the Medicare Care Choices Model. The model will involve a team-based approach, include various services, and be accessible 24/7. It will be assessed using metrics related to demographics, healthcare utilization, hospice care, and patient experience.",
