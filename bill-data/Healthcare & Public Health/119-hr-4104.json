    "summary": "This bill, the Health Equity and Access under the Law for Immigrant Families Act of 2025, aims to expand health insurance access for immigrants and their families. It removes legal and policy barriers preventing lawfully present individuals from accessing Medicaid, CHIP, and other health programs. The bill also addresses access to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including premium tax credits, cost-sharing reductions, and basic health program eligibility. It permits states to extend Medicaid and CHIP coverage to individuals without lawful presence and defines 'lawfully present' for Medicare purposes. The bill's provisions include effective dates and conforming amendments.",
