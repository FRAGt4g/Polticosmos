    "summary": "The Clinical Trial Modernization Act aims to improve clinical trial participation, particularly among underrepresented populations. The bill authorizes grants for community outreach and education, allows for payment of participant expenses like travel and digital health technologies, and clarifies anti-kickback statutes to facilitate these payments. Furthermore, it excludes remuneration from clinical trials from gross income up to $2,000 and clarifies that cost-sharing support from sponsors is not a violation of certain laws, provided it meets specified requirements.",
