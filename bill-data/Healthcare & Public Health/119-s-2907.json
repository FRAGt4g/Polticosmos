    "summary": "The Chloe Cole Act prohibits healthcare professionals, hospitals, and clinics from performing chemical or surgical mutilation on children, defining such procedures as those that halt or change a child's body to no longer correspond with their sex. Exceptions are made for medically necessary treatments for verifiable disorders of sexual development, and for treatment of injury or illness. The bill allows for a private right of action for those harmed, with provisions for damages. It also includes limitations on the scope of the Act, such as not applying to counseling or referrals, and sets a 25-year statute of limitations.",
