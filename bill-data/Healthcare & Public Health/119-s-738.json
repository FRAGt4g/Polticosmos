    "summary": "The Dangerous Viral Gain of Function Research Moratorium Act aims to halt federal funding for institutions conducting gain-of-function research on dangerous viruses. This includes research that genetically alters organisms to enhance their infectivity, transmissibility, pathogenicity, or host range, or that poses a threat to national security, public safety, or animal/human health. The bill defines \"gain-of-function research\" and specifies the types of organisms covered. It prohibits federal research grants to entities engaged in such research, regardless of other laws.",
