    "summary": "This bill, the Overdose RADAR Act, aims to combat the fentanyl crisis. It mandates improved data collection on opioid-related overdoses, including postmortem toxicology and data linkage. It also reforms the Office of National Drug Control Policy, requiring it to document strategies to avoid duplication, collaborate on data standards, and issue guidance on recording overdose deaths. The bill also amends existing legislation concerning state opioid response grants, wastewater pilot programs, and grants for reducing opioid overdose deaths, particularly in schools, including providing drugs and devices for emergency treatment and fentanyl test strips.",
