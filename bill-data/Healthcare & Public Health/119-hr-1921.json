    "summary": "The Hearing Device Coverage Clarification Act aims to ensure that fully implanted active middle ear hearing devices are recognized as prosthetics under the Medicare program. The bill directs the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to clarify within 60 days of enactment that these devices are not subject to the existing hearing aid coverage exclusion. This would make it easier for Medicare beneficiaries to receive coverage for these hearing loss solutions.",
