    "summary": "H.R. 88, titled the \"Medical Innovation Acceleration Act of 2025,\" seeks to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The bill's main purpose is to exempt certain \"non-invasive diagnostic devices\" from regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It specifically defines a non-invasive device as one that does not penetrate the skin or any body membrane, isn't implanted, causes only minor, temporary changes like compression or temperature shifts, and does not use ionizing radiation. By removing FDA oversight for this category of devices, the legislation aims to accelerate their development and market entry.",
