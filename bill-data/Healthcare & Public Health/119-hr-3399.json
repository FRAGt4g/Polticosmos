    "summary": "The Care for Military Kids Act of 2025 amends the Social Security Act to address Medicaid coverage and residency for military families. It focuses on active-duty service members and their dependents who relocate across state lines. The bill mandates that states treat active-duty individuals as residents for Medicaid eligibility, unless they decline, and addresses home and community-based services waiting lists. It also includes implementation funding and outlines an effective date, with a delay provision for states requiring legislative changes. ",
