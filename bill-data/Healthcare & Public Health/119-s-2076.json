States must apply and detail how they'll use the funds, with a focus on improving HCBS delivery by increasing worker pay and benefits, expanding services, and supporting eligible individuals. The bill also includes reporting requirements and an evaluation of its effectiveness by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.",
