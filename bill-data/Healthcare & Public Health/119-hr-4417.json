    "summary": "The Mobile Cancer Screening Act aims to amend the Public Health Service Act to support new mobile cancer screening units. The bill authorizes grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements to eligible entities for purchasing mobile units, acquiring imaging technology, and covering operational costs. It prioritizes applicants with high impact on patient mortality, those serving underserved populations (especially rural and areas served by the Indian Health Service), and those offering timely follow-up care. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is mandated to report to Congress on the program's impact, requiring a $15,000,000 appropriation for each of fiscal years 2027-2031.",
