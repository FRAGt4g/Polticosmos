It mandates a GAO study on existing federal initiatives, trends in transplant wait-list mortality, and the cost-effectiveness of newborn screening for biliary atresia. The bill also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create and disseminate public education materials on early signs of liver disease and living liver donation. Finally, it requires a GAO report on the results of the public education program.",
