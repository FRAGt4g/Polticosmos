    "summary": "The Fair Prescription Drug Prices for Americans Act aims to regulate the retail prices of prescription drugs and biological products in the United States. It mandates that the list price in the US cannot exceed the average retail list price in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom. It tasks the Secretary of Health and Human Services with calculating this average annually using data from manufacturers and public records. The bill includes civil monetary penalties for violations, based on the price difference multiplied by a factor of 10, per unit sold. Manufacturers are required to submit pricing data to the Secretary annually.",
