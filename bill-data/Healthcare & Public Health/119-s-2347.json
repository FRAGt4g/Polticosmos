    "summary": "The Equal Health Care for All Act (S. 2347) aims to prohibit discrimination in healthcare and promote equitable care. It mandates data collection and reporting on health outcomes disaggregated by demographic characteristics. The bill amends the Social Security Act to incorporate equitable health care measures in the hospital value-based purchasing program and as a basis for excluding providers from Medicare/Medicaid for inequitable practices. It also establishes the Office for Civil Rights and Health Equity, creates a Federal Health Equity Commission to monitor progress, and provides grants to hospitals to improve equitable care and outcomes. The bill defines inequitable health care and provides enforcement mechanisms, including a private right of action.",
