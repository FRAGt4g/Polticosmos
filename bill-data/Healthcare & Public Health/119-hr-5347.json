    "summary": "This bill, the Health Care Efficiency Through Flexibility Act, amends the Social Security Act to improve quality reporting under the Medicare Shared Savings Program. It mandates the availability of specific collection types (electronic clinical quality measures, MIPS, and Medicare Clinical Quality Measures). It also establishes a pilot program for digital quality measure reporting from 2028-2032, allowing the Secretary to select ACOs to report measures digitally and potentially waive other reporting requirements. The Secretary will also analyze the pilot program and provide recommendations.",
