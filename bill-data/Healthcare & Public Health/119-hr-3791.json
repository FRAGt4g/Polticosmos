    "summary": "The EMS Counts Act mandates the Secretary of Labor to revise the Standard Occupational Classification System to accurately count emergency medical services (EMS) practitioners in the United States. It recognizes the critical role of EMS personnel and highlights the current undercounting, particularly regarding dual-role firefighter/EMTs and firefighter/paramedics. The bill requires the inclusion of these roles in the firefighter occupational series and mandates reports to Congress on past actions and implementation of the revisions.",
