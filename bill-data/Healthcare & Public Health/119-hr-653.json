    "summary": "The 'Protect Minors from Medical Malpractice Act of 2025' aims to protect minors from gender-transition procedures. It establishes a private right of action, allowing individuals injured by such procedures to sue medical practitioners up to 30 years after turning 18. The bill defines gender-transition procedures and provides exceptions. It prohibits federal law from requiring medical practitioners to perform these procedures and denies federal funding to states mandating them. The bill also defines \"biological sex\" for the purpose of the act.",
