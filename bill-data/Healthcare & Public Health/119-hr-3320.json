    "summary": "The Strengthening Medicaid for Serious Mental Illness Act aims to increase federal Medicaid funding for states offering intensive community-based services to adults with serious mental illnesses. The bill defines these services, including assertive community treatment, supported employment, peer support, and others. It outlines eligibility criteria, quality standards, and data reporting requirements for states receiving increased funding. The legislation also provides for planning grants to states to facilitate the development of State plan amendments and emphasizes that the bill doesn't restrict existing mental health services for children.",
