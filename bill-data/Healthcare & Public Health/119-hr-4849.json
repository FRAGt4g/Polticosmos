    "summary": "The Protecting Health Care and Lowering Costs Act of 2025 aims to repeal health-related provisions from a prior reconciliation act (Public Law 119-21). It primarily focuses on modifying the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by expanding eligibility for premium tax credits. The bill removes the 400% income limit for eligibility and adjusts the applicable premium percentages based on household income, increasing subsidies. It also includes conforming amendments and specifies an effective date for the changes.",
