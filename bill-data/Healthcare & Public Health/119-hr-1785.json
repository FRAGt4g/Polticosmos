    "summary": "The Preventing Medicare Telefraud Act aims to combat potential fraud in Medicare by establishing new requirements for the provision of high-cost durable medical equipment and laboratory tests via telehealth. It mandates in-person patient visits within a 6-month window prior to ordering such services. The bill also requires Medicare administrative contractors to conduct audits of providers who heavily rely on telehealth for these services and requires the submission of the NPI number for separately billable telehealth services.",
