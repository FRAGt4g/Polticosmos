    "summary": "This bill, the Reducing Drug Prices for Seniors Act, amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to change how Medicare Part D coinsurance for prescription drugs is calculated. It mandates that coinsurance be based on the drug's actual acquisition cost rather than the wholesale acquisition cost, specifically for costs between the annual deductible and the out-of-pocket threshold. This change aims to lower drug costs for seniors by leveraging the negotiated pricing of drugs.",
