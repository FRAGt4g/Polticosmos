    "summary": "This bill, known as the DOCTORS Act, aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. It focuses on reallocating unused waivers of the foreign residency requirement for certain J-visa holders. Beginning in 2026, State agencies will report unused waivers. The Secretary of State will then reallocate these waivers, distributing them among eligible State agencies.  A portion of these reallocated waivers will be directed to support facilities serving medically underserved communities.",
