It outlines payment structures, including per-episode payments, adjustments, and quality incentives. The bill also addresses patient transportation assistance and exempts the program from budget neutrality adjustments. Furthermore, it modifies civil monetary penalties regarding patient transportation and excludes participating providers from the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System.",
