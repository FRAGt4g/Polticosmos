    "summary": "The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act mandates that healthcare practitioners provide the same standard of care to infants who survive abortions or attempted abortions as they would any other newborn.  It requires reporting of violations to law enforcement and outlines penalties for non-compliance, including fines and imprisonment.  Civil remedies are provided for women upon whom abortions are performed, including damages and attorney's fees.  The bill amends existing federal law to reflect these provisions.",
