    "summary": "The Retirement Freedom Act (H.R. 2793) allows individuals eligible for Medicare Part A benefits to opt out. The bill specifies the process for opting out, clarifies individuals are not penalized for opting back in, and that opting out of Part A does not require opting out of Social Security Title II benefits.  Crucially, it stipulates individuals do not need to repay amounts paid under Part A prior to making the election to opt out.",
