    "summary": "The Prompt Approval of Safe Generic Drugs Act aims to expedite the approval of generic drugs by addressing the issue of omitted safety information in their labeling. The bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow for approval even if labeling lacks certain safety details protected by exclusivity or patents, requiring the Secretary to mandate inclusion of essential safety information. This aims to speed up the availability of generic drugs.",
