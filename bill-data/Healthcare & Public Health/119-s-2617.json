    "summary": "This bill, the Reducing Drug Prices for Seniors Act, amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to change how coinsurance for Medicare Part D drugs is calculated. It mandates that coinsurance be based on the drug's net price (negotiated price minus manufacturer concessions) rather than the list price, for drugs that have a net price lower than the list price. This change aims to lower out-of-pocket costs for seniors on Medicare.",
