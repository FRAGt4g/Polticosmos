    "summary": "The Dialysis-Related Amyloidosis Treatment Act of 2025 amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide Medicare coverage and payment for treatments for dialysis-related amyloidosis. The bill defines \"treatments for dialysis-related amyloidosis,\" excludes these treatments from renal dialysis service payments, and mandates separate payment at 100% of reasonable charges. This aims to improve patient access to necessary treatments for a specific medical condition related to dialysis.",
