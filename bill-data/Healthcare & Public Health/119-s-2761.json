    "summary": "The 'Reforming and Enhancing Sustainable Updates to Laboratory Testing Services Act of 2025' (RESULTS Act) aims to improve the accuracy and data collection methods for setting Medicare payment rates for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests. It focuses on using data from comprehensive claims databases, particularly for non-advanced diagnostic tests. The bill mandates data collection from a qualifying independent claims data entity, defines various terms, and adjusts payment calculations based on the collected data. This includes provisions for scenarios where data is unavailable and modifications to payment reduction limits.",
