    "summary": "This bill, the \"Strategy for Public Health Preparedness and Response to Artificial Intelligence Threats,\" directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a strategy for public health preparedness and response to the misuse of artificial intelligence that poses threats to national health security. The strategy must include a framework for preparedness, identify gaps in current capabilities, and outline strategies to mitigate risks, particularly those related to the development of biological weapons and treatment-resistant viruses. It also amends the Public Health Service Act to incorporate this AI-focused strategy into all-hazards emergency preparedness.",
