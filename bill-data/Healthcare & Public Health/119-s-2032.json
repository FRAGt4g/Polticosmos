    "summary": "The 'Choose Medicare Act' proposes establishing Medicare Part E public health plans, available in individual, small group, and large group markets. These plans would offer gold-level coverage, including essential health benefits, all services under Title XVIII, and abortion/reproductive services. The bill addresses eligibility, enrollment, premium rates, provider reimbursement, and integrates alternative payment models. It includes provisions for employer-sponsored plans and portability and appropriates funds for startup and initial reserves. Furthermore, it amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to include navigator referrals for employees, addresses out-of-pocket spending limits, enhances premium assistance, modifies reduced cost-sharing, and establishes a reinsurance fund. Finally, the bill expands rating rules, strengthens consumer protections against unfair rates and includes a sense of Congress regarding reproductive services coverage.",
