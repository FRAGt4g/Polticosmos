    "summary": "The Skin Substitute Access and Payment Reform Act of 2025 aims to revise Medicare payment rules for skin substitute products. It mandates a volume-weighted average payment limit calculated from 2023 data and adjusted annually. The bill defines skin substitute products, excluding certain dressings and other products, and requires a new billing code. It also establishes consistent criteria for determining their medical necessity and prevents the Secretary of Health and Human Services from solely using clinical evidence to deem them unnecessary. Manufacturers are exempt from reporting the average sales price.",
