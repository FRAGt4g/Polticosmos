    "summary": "This bill, the 'Freedom for Farmers Act of 2025,' proposes to abolish the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) one year after its enactment. Most of the agency's functions would be terminated, but its authority to maintain national registries of serious diseases and persons exposed to toxic substances would be preserved. This specific function, along with related assets and personnel, would be transferred to another agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. The bill also includes numerous technical amendments to various federal laws, removing all references to the now-abolished ATSDR.",
