    "summary": "The Pathways to Health Careers Act (H.R. 5370) aims to provide low-income individuals with opportunities for careers in the health professions. It amends the Social Security Act to authorize grants for career pathway programs. These programs would offer training, support services (including childcare and transportation), and post-employment assistance. The bill emphasizes partnerships with local organizations and targets specific populations, including those with arrest/conviction records and those in maternal health. It also mandates evaluations, reports to Congress, and specifies funding allocation.",
