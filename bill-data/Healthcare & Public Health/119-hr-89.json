    "summary": "The Prescription Freedom Act of 2025 seeks to eliminate the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) authority to classify drugs as 'prescription-only' at the federal level. Six months after enactment, the power to regulate which drugs require a prescription would transfer to individual states. Existing federal references to prescription drugs would default to state law definitions. The bill includes a key exception, allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to continue requiring prescriptions for drugs intended to terminate a pregnancy, keeping them under federal oversight.",
