    "summary": "The Indian Programs Advance Appropriations Act of 2025 aims to amend the Indian Self-Determination Act and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. It proposes advance appropriations for specific accounts within the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Indian Education, and the Indian Health Service, beginning in fiscal year 2026. The bill mandates detailed budget estimates for these accounts, requires annual reports on resource sufficiency, and amends related sections of existing legislation to incorporate these changes and provide budget justifications. The goal is to provide more predictable funding for services to Indigenous communities.",
