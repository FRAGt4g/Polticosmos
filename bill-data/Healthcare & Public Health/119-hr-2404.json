    "summary": "The Remote Opioid Monitoring Act of 2025 mandates a study by the Comptroller General of the United States on the use of remote monitoring for individuals prescribed opioids. The study, due within 18 months, will assess the efficacy, individual outcomes, and potential cost savings of remote monitoring. It will also examine the current prevalence of such monitoring, including its use internationally, and provide recommendations to enhance availability, access, and coverage, potentially through federal healthcare program adjustments. The goal is to identify individuals who benefit most.",
