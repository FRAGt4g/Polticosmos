    "summary": "The Fatal Overdose Reduction Act of 2025 proposes to amend the Social Security Act to establish the Health Engagement Hub Demonstration Program. This program aims to increase access to treatment for opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders through state-certified Health Engagement Hubs. These hubs would provide a range of social and medical services, with a focus on harm reduction, medication management, and peer support. The bill outlines certification criteria, a prospective payment system, and reporting requirements, as well as providing funding for planning grants and a national implementation evaluation. The program prioritizes communities disproportionately impacted by substance use.",
