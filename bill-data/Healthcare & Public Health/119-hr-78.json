    "summary": "The Pregnant Women Health and Safety Act of 2025 proposes new federal regulations for abortion providers. It would require physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 15 miles and to notify the patient of that hospital's location. Failing to comply would be a federal offense punishable by fines and imprisonment. Additionally, the bill mandates that for an abortion clinic to receive any federal funds, it must be state-licensed and meet the same standards as an ambulatory surgery center, with some potential for waivers.",
