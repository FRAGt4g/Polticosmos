    "summary": "This bill, the \"Preserving Life-saving Access to Specialty Medicines in America Act\" or the \"PLASMA Act,\" amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to introduce a phase-in for plasma-derived products under the manufacturer discount program. It defines 'plasma-derived product' and outlines a decreasing percentage discount schedule for these drugs, varying based on whether the beneficiary has met the out-of-pocket threshold. Certain drugs dispensed to LIS beneficiaries or by small manufacturers are exempt from this phase-in.",
