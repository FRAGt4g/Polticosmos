    "summary": "This bill, the \"Improving Access to Transfusion Care for Hospice Patients Act of 2025,\" aims to improve access to blood transfusions for hospice patients. It mandates the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMI) to test a model that separates payments for blood transfusions from the Medicare hospice all-inclusive per diem payment. The bill directs the CMI to evaluate the model using various metrics, including hospital utilization, transfusion frequency, and the number of transfusions, comparing patients under the model to similar patients not receiving hospice care.",
