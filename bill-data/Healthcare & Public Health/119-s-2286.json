    "summary": "This bill, the State-Based Universal Health Care Act of 2025, allows states to apply for waivers to establish their own universal healthcare systems. It amends the Affordable Care Act to provide a framework for these state-based plans, including requirements for comprehensive coverage, coverage for all residents, and budget neutrality for the federal government. The bill outlines the process for waiver applications, public comment, and federal oversight, including an independent assessment panel and a requirement for states to achieve health coverage for at least 95% of state residents within a set timeframe. It also covers coordination among relevant federal agencies and addresses specific considerations for American Indians and Alaska Natives.",
