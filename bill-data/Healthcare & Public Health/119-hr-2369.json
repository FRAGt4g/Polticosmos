It defines qualified sports and fitness expenses, which include membership fees to fitness facilities, participation in physical activities, and equipment costs. It sets a dollar limitation ($1,000 for individuals, $2,000 for joint filers) on the deductible amount and specifies criteria for fitness facilities and equipment. The bill aims to promote health and prevent disease by incentivizing healthy lifestyles.",
