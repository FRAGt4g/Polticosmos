    "summary": "The Mental Health Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2025 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide loans and loan guarantees to construct, renovate, or improve pediatric and adult mental health and substance use disorder treatment facilities. The bill prioritizes facilities increasing bed capacity or serving high-need communities. It mandates a set-aside for facilities primarily serving children, specifies loan terms and conditions, and establishes a Mental Health and Substance Use Treatment Trust Fund to which excess revenues from the loan program are appropriated. Funding is capped at $200 million per year from 2026-2030.",
