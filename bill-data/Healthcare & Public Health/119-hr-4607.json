    "summary": "The Samaritan Efforts to Ensure Key Health Emergency and Life-saving Protections Act, or the SEEK HELP Act, aims to protect individuals who seek medical assistance for drug overdoses from prosecution. It provides civil and criminal liability protections, focusing on good faith actions. The bill defines key terms like \"seek medical assistance\" and \"opioid overdose reversal drug.\" It mandates a public awareness campaign and allows for the use of grant funding for state and local overdose Good Samaritan law education and training. It also calls for a GAO report to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of these Good Samaritan laws.",
