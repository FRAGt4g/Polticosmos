It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to release accreditation surveys for hospitals and psychiatric hospitals, including a standardized form (CMS\u20132567 or its successor). The bill also requires the publication of relevant information on the Care Compare website, allowing consumers to make informed healthcare decisions. The Secretary must collaborate with stakeholders to determine appropriate information disclosure, ensuring patient and provider privacy.",
