    "summary": "The Health Care Workforce Expansion Act of 2025 aims to address healthcare workforce shortages. It establishes grant programs for medical, dental, and nursing schools, providing financial aid (MED, DENTAL, and NURSE grants) to students in exchange for service commitments after graduation.  The bill also provides grants to expand student enrollment at health profession schools, increases payments to teaching health centers, and distributes additional Medicare GME residency positions, particularly in psychiatry and primary care.  Finally, it creates a Rural Relocation Grant Program to incentivize healthcare professionals to practice in rural areas.",
