    "summary": "This bill, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act of 2025, aims to prevent unfair and deceptive practices by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). It prohibits PBMs from certain pricing practices, such as charging different amounts to health plans than pharmacies, and clawbacks if not meeting specific conditions. The bill mandates transparency through reporting requirements to the FTC and HHS and establishes whistleblower protections. It also includes enforcement mechanisms via the FTC and state attorneys general and directs a GAO study on PBMs' roles in the pharmaceutical supply chain.",
