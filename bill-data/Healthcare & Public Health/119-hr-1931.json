    "summary": "The Access to Pediatric Technologies Act of 2025 aims to improve patient access to specific medical devices for children. It amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to compel the Secretary to establish national relative value units for qualifying pediatric technologies under the physician fee schedule. The bill defines qualifying pediatric technology and outlines the process for manufacturers to request the establishment of these units, including providing relevant data like pricing and usage information. This focuses on ensuring these approved technologies are properly considered for access and reimbursement within the healthcare system.",
