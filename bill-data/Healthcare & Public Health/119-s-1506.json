    "summary": "The Medicare for All Act (S.1506) proposes a national health insurance program providing comprehensive health care to all U.S. residents. It establishes a Medicare for All Program, outlining universal entitlement, comprehensive benefits (including long-term care, dental, vision, and hearing), and no patient cost-sharing (with exceptions for prescription drugs). The bill addresses provider participation, administration, quality of care, national health budgeting, and conforming amendments to ERISA. It includes provisions for a Medicare Trust Fund, transition plans (Medicare buy-in, public option), and aims to eliminate existing federal health programs (Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP) while protecting veterans and Native Americans' healthcare. The bill also includes provisions addressing health equity, primary health care, and provides for cost containment measures.",
