    "summary": "The Homecare for Seniors Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow qualified distributions from health savings accounts (HSAs) to be used for certain home care expenses. Specifically, it defines \"qualified home care\" as a contract for services like assistance with eating, toileting, and medication adherence provided by a licensed provider. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, is directed to increase public awareness regarding these HSA-eligible expenses. The changes take affect for taxable years beginning after the bill's enactment.",
