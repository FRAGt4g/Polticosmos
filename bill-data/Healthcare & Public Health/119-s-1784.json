    "summary": "This bill, the Mapping America's Pharmaceutical Supply Act (MAPS Act), aims to improve the coordination of federal efforts to identify and mitigate health and national security risks related to the pharmaceutical supply chain. It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to maintain and update a list of essential medicines. The bill requires a risk assessment of these medicines, mapping of supply chains, and annual reporting to Congress. It also directs the Department of Defense to report on drug purchases from China. The goal is to enhance supply chain transparency and address potential vulnerabilities, particularly concerning national security.",
