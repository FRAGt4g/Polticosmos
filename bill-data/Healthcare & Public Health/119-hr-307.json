    "summary": "The \"Amputation Reduction and Compassion Act of 2025\" aims to decrease preventable amputations caused by peripheral artery disease (PAD). It amends the Social Security Act to provide Medicare and Medicaid coverage for PAD screening tests for at-risk beneficiaries, eliminating patient cost-sharing for these services. The bill defines at-risk groups based on age and health factors like diabetes. It also establishes a national PAD education program, directs the development of quality measures to encourage amputation alternatives, and creates a pilot program to promote amputation prevention, focusing on early detection to reduce amputations in vulnerable populations.",
