    "summary": "The 'Reducing Medically Unnecessary Delays in Care Act of 2025' mandates that Medicare contractors, Medicare Advantage plans, and prescription drug plans adhere to specific requirements for prior authorization of healthcare services. The bill focuses on ensuring that prior authorization decisions are based on medical necessity and written clinical criteria, with input from physicians. It requires transparency through website postings of requirements, advance notice of changes, and statistics on approvals and denials. A key provision mandates that preauthorizations and adverse determinations be made by physicians with relevant specializations.",
