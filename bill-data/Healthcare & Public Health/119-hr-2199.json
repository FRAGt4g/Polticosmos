    "summary": "This bill, the Restore Protections for Dialysis Patients Act, aims to amend the Social Security Act to protect individuals with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) from discrimination by private health plans. It clarifies and preserves protections under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act (MSPA). Specifically, it prevents health plans from differentiating benefits or applying limitations that disparately affect ESRD patients compared to other covered individuals, excluding provider network constraints. The bill's purpose is to ensure equal treatment and prevent cost-shifting to Medicare.",
