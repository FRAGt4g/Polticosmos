    "summary": "The 'Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2025' aims to expand Medicare coverage for obesity treatment and prevention. It allows a wider range of healthcare providers to furnish intensive behavioral therapy for obesity, including non-primary care physicians, physician assistants, dietitians, and approved lifestyle counseling programs. The bill also amends Medicare Part D to potentially cover obesity medications and mandates a regular report to Congress on the Department of Health and Human Services' efforts to implement the Act.",
