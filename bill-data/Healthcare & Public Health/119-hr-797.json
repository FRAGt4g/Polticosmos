    "summary": "The 'Ultrasounds Save Lives Act of 2025' mandates that abortion providers perform an ultrasound and share the results with women seeking abortions before obtaining informed consent. The bill requires a signed Informed Consent Authorization form, presented 24 hours prior to the procedure, detailing the gestational age, medical risks, and developmental characteristics of the unborn child. It outlines penalties for non-compliance, including civil penalties for providers and a private right of action for women. Exceptions are made in medical emergencies. The bill seeks to ensure that women are fully informed before making a decision on abortion.",
