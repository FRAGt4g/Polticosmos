    "summary": "This bill, the Federal Animal Research Accountability Act of 2025, amends the Public Health Service Act to enhance the accuracy and transparency of animal use data collected by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It mandates that research entities annually file a form with the NIH Director detailing animal usage, categorized by species and level of pain or distress. The NIH Director is required to make this information available to animal care committees and, later, in a publicly accessible database. The changes take effect two years after enactment.",
