    "summary": "The Neonatal Care Transparency Act of 2025 mandates hospitals and obstetricians to publicly disclose their policies regarding life-saving care for premature infants. It requires disclosure of minimum gestational age for intervention and transfer procedures if the hospital lacks the capacity to provide care. The bill amends the Social Security Act to withhold Medicaid and CHIP funding from hospitals and providers failing to comply with these disclosure requirements. The goal is to increase transparency for parents and ensure access to appropriate medical intervention.",
