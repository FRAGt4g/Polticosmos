    "summary": "The 'Prescription Drug Transparency and Affordability Act' (H.R. 2450) aims to increase oversight of pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services. The bill mandates PBMs to disclose detailed information to group health plans, including drug pricing, rebates, and spending data. It amends the Public Health Service Act, ERISA, and the Internal Revenue Code to enforce these reporting requirements, providing for penalties for non-compliance and requiring plain-language summaries for plan participants and beneficiaries to improve transparency regarding drug costs and benefit design.",
