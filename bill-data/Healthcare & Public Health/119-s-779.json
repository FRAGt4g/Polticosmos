    "summary": "The 'Early Action and Responsiveness Lifts Youth Minds Act' (EARLY Minds Act) aims to amend the Public Health Service Act to enhance early intervention and prevention services for youth mental health. It allows states to allocate up to 5% of their Community Mental Health Services program funding toward evidence-based prevention and early intervention programs focused on children and adolescents, regardless of whether they have a serious mental illness or emotional disturbance. The bill also requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the outcomes of these programs, including their impact on access to care and the severity of mental illness.",
