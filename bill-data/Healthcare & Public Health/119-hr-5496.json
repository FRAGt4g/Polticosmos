    "summary": "This bill, the Helping Ensure Access to Local TeleHealth Act of 2025 (HEALTH Act of 2025), amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide permanent Medicare payments for telehealth services furnished by federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and rural health clinics (RHCs). It defines 'telecommunications system' to include audio-only communication, mandates HHS to update regulations, makes telehealth payments permanent, and eliminates originating site requirements for telehealth services provided by FQHCs and RHCs, also providing a special payment rule for originating sites involved in these services.",
