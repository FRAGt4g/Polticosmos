    "summary": "The 'Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2025' amends the Social Security Act to clarify payment rules for manual wheelchairs under Medicare Part B. It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create separate HCPCS codes for ultralightweight manual wheelchairs based on construction material (titanium/carbon fiber vs. other materials). The bill outlines payment procedures, allowing suppliers to charge beneficiaries the difference between the Medicare payment and the actual cost, while also requiring the Secretary to establish a notification system for potential financial liabilities.",
