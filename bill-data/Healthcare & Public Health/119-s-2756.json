    "summary": "The Affordable Inhalers and Nebulizers Act of 2025 aims to reduce patient cost-sharing for prescription inhaler products used to treat respiratory illnesses like asthma and COPD.  It amends the Public Health Service Act, Internal Revenue Code, and Employee Retirement Income Security Act to cap cost-sharing at $15 per 30-day supply and prohibit deductibles for specified inhaler products under various insurance plans, including Medicare.  It also establishes a payment program for uninsured individuals to access these medications.",
