    "summary": "The Restoring Rights of Medical Residents Act (H.R. 3018) seeks to repeal the antitrust exemption currently in place for graduate medical resident matching programs. This effectively removes the legal protection that allows these programs to operate without being subject to antitrust laws. The bill's short title is the Restoring Rights of Medical Residents Act. It amends the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004 and would take effect on the March 18th following its enactment.",
