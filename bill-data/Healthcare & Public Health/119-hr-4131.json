    "summary": "The bill, titled the Respectful Treatment of Unborn Remains Act of 2025, aims to prohibit abortion providers from disposing of fetal remains in publicly owned water systems. It defines key terms like 'abortion,' 'abortion provider,' 'fetal remains,' and 'publicly owned water system.' Violators face fines and imprisonment. Crucially, the bill doesn't hold the individual who undergoes the abortion liable. It also allows states and local authorities to enact more restrictive measures. The Act is intended to address the disposal of fetal remains.",
