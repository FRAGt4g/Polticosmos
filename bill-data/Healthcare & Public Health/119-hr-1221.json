    "summary": "The Social Security and Medicare Lock-Box Act aims to protect Social Security and Medicare surpluses. It establishes dedicated accounts within the existing trust funds to hold these surpluses. The bill prevents the investment of these surplus amounts until alternative investment options, beyond U.S. obligations, are authorized by federal law. Furthermore, the Act mandates the creation of a commission to study and recommend effective investment vehicles for these funds, excluding U.S. debt.",
