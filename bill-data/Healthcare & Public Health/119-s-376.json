    "summary": "The Expanded Food Safety Investigation Act of 2025 grants the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority to conduct microbial sampling at concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). This is intended to aid in investigating foodborne illness outbreaks, determining the root causes, and addressing public health needs. CAFOs must provide reasonable access for sampling, while the FDA will coordinate with other relevant agencies like the Department of Agriculture. The bill also amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include penalties for refusing access for sampling.",
