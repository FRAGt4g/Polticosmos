    "summary": "This bill, the \"Stopping Pharma\u2019s Ripoffs and Drug Savings For All Act,\" aims to prevent pharmaceutical companies from using multiple patents to extend the exclusivity period of their drugs, a practice known as double patenting. It amends Title 35 of the United States Code regarding patent disclaimers, specifically focusing on drug patents. The bill also mandates the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to review its examination procedures to prevent the issuance of non-distinct patents and to report its findings and recommendations to the House Judiciary Committee.",
