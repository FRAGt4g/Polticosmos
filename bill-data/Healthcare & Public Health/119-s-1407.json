    "summary": "The 'Anyone But China Safe Drug Act' (ABC Safe Drug Act) proposes to restrict the purchase of drugs by federal agencies and programs. Starting in 2028, at least 60% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in purchased drugs must be manufactured outside of China and in countries that meet FDA standards. By 2030, this rises to 100%. The bill also mandates country-of-origin labeling for drug ingredients and provides temporary tax incentives for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing in the U.S. that will expire at the end of 2030.",
