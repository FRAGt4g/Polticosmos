    "summary": "The 'End Price Gouging for Medications Act' aims to lower prescription drug costs. It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish annual reference prices for prescription drugs based on the lowest retail prices in several reference countries. This reference price would then be the maximum retail list price for the drug within various federal health programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and VA healthcare. Drug manufacturers who do not comply face significant financial penalties, with funds directed towards drug research and development.",
