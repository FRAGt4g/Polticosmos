    "summary": "The 'Helping Tobacco Users Quit Act' (S. 2064) amends the Social Security Act to provide comprehensive tobacco cessation services under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). It mandates coverage for counseling and pharmacotherapy, prohibits cost-sharing for these services, and exempts tobacco cessation drugs from certain restrictions. The bill also includes provisions for state monitoring, outreach campaigns, and enhanced federal funding for cessation services and related campaigns. Separate sections address CHIP, including federal reimbursement and no prior authorization for cessation drugs, and also the effective dates of these amendments.",
