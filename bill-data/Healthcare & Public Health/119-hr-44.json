    "summary": "The 'Rural 340B Access Act of 2025,' a bipartisan bill from Reps. Bergman and Dingell, seeks to amend the Public Health Service Act. It proposes making 'rural emergency hospitals' eligible for the 340B drug discount program, which provides significant discounts on outpatient drugs. To qualify, these hospitals must be government-owned, non-profits with governmental powers, or non-profits contracted to serve low-income individuals. The legislation aims to improve the financial stability of these facilities and enhance healthcare access for underserved populations in rural areas.",
