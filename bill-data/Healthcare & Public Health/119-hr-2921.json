    "summary": "The Federal Firefighter Cancer Detection and Prevention Act of 2025 mandates the Secretary of Defense to provide Department of Defense firefighters with medical testing and related services to detect and prevent certain cancers. These services include screenings for breast, colon, and prostate cancers, as well as other cancers identified as higher risk for firefighters. The bill outlines specific testing schedules based on age and risk factors, requires documentation of testing and results, and allows firefighters to opt out. It also defines key terms and allows for data sharing with the CDC, ensuring privacy. ",
