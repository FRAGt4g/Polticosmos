    "summary": "The Peer Education and Emergency Response for Mental Health Act of 2025 (H.R. 1448) aims to address mental health concerns in schools. It authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities (schools, local and state education agencies) to train teachers, school staff, students, and parents. This training focuses on recognizing mental health conditions, referring students to services, and applying mental health first aid. The bill also mandates education on community resources. A portion of the funding is allocated for schools in rural areas, with technical assistance provided to grant applicants. The bill authorizes appropriations of $24,963,000 annually for fiscal years 2026-2030.",
