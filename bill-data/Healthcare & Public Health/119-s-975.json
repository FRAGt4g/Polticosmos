    "summary": "The Expanding Medical Education Act proposes a grant program to support schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine, particularly those in underserved areas. The Secretary of Health can award grants for establishing, improving, or expanding these schools and their branch campuses. Grants prioritize schools in areas lacking such institutions, especially minority-serving institutions, and those serving medically underserved communities. Funds can be used for student recruitment, curriculum development emphasizing care for underserved populations, and various operational costs. The bill mandates annual reports from grant recipients and a comprehensive report to Congress every five years, analyzing program outcomes related to student demographics, healthcare access, and workforce impact. The bill defines key terms like \"branch campus\", \"first generation college student,\" \"health professional shortage area,\" and \"medically underserved community.\"",
