    "summary": "The \"Healthcare Freedom Act of 2025\" proposes replacing Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) with universally available \"Health Freedom Accounts\" (HFAs), eliminating the requirement for a high-deductible health plan. It significantly increases annual contribution limits to $12,000 for individuals ($24,000 for joint filers) and expands qualified expenses to include direct primary care and health sharing ministries. For employees hired five years after enactment, the bill would phase out the tax exclusion for traditional employer-provided health insurance, replacing it with a tax exclusion for employer contributions made directly to an employee's HFA, shifting towards individual-controlled healthcare financing.",
