    "summary": "The Advancing Student Services In Schools Today Act (ASSIST Act) aims to improve access to mental health and substance use disorder care for students. The bill increases the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for state expenditures on behavioral health services provided by mental health and substance use disorder care providers in schools and school-based health centers. It also authorizes grants to eligible entities (schools, universities, etc.) to increase the number of these providers in schools and centers, requiring annual reporting on the program's effectiveness and defining the eligible providers. The bill seeks to address the negative impact of limited access to these services on children's health.",
