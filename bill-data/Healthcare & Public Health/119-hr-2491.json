This includes reducing paperwork, improving communication with agencies, providing information, and addressing accessibility concerns. Reports to Congress are required detailing findings, actions to be taken, costs, and potential legislative changes. The bill also encourages states to conduct similar reviews and provides best practices to support caregivers.",
