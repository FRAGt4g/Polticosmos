    "summary": "The 'Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2025' amends Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to clarify Medicare payment rules for manual wheelchairs.  It mandates the Secretary establish separate HCPCS codes for ultralightweight manual wheelchairs based on base construction material (titanium/carbon fiber vs. other). Payment for wheelchairs with titanium/carbon fiber bases aligns with existing payment structures, with beneficiaries potentially responsible for the difference between the payment amount and the supplier's actual charge.  The Secretary may require suppliers to notify beneficiaries of potential costs.",
