    "summary": "The Teleabortion Prevention Act of 2025 aims to prohibit chemical abortions performed without a healthcare provider physically present. It amends Title 18 of the United States Code to define chemical abortions, outline offenses for healthcare providers violating the provisions, and specify that patients cannot be prosecuted. The bill includes definitions related to abortion drugs, attempts to provide, and healthcare providers, and clarifies that the law does not impact treatment for ectopic pregnancies. It also proposes clerical amendments to the chapter heading and table of sections.",
