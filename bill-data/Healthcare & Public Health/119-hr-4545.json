    "summary": "The Medicare Breast Reconstruction Access and Information Act amends title XVIII of the Social Security Act to ensure that individuals undergoing mastectomies are informed about Medicare coverage for breast reconstruction surgery. The bill mandates that suppliers providing mastectomies inform patients about this coverage and document the provision of this information in the patient's medical record. This aims to improve access to information and potentially increase access to breast reconstruction for Medicare beneficiaries.",
