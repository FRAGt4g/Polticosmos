    "summary": "The Living Donor Protection Act of 2025 aims to protect living organ donors from discrimination by insurance companies. The bill prohibits insurers from denying, canceling, or altering the terms of life, disability, or long-term care insurance policies based solely on a person's status as a living organ donor. The bill also mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to update educational materials on the benefits and risks of living organ donation, including information on the new protections.",
