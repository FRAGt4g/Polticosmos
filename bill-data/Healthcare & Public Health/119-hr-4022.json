    "summary": "This bill, the Increasing Behavioral Health Treatment Act, aims to reform Medicaid coverage for mental health services. It removes the exclusion of items and services for patients in institutions for mental diseases (IMDs) under Medicaid, requiring states to submit plans for improved outpatient and community-based mental health care. The bill mandates state plans to address access to crisis services, data sharing among providers, and screening for co-morbid conditions. States must also report costs, utilization, and treatment received by individuals after discharge from IMDs. The bill's effective date is upon enactment, with provisions for states needing legislative changes.",
