    "summary": "The 'No Mandates Act' is a bill that seeks to prohibit COVID-19 vaccination requirements. It would prevent federal agencies from issuing any rules mandating the vaccine and would forbid requiring proof of vaccination for access to federal properties or services. Furthermore, any entity receiving federal funds, including COVID-19 relief aid, would be barred from requiring vaccination as a condition for providing its services. Entities that do not comply with this provision would be required to return all federal funds they have received.",
