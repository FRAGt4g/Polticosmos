    "summary": "The Fair Access In Residency Act of 2025 (FAIR Act) amends the Social Security Act to require hospitals with approved medical residency training programs to submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services data on applicants from osteopathic and allopathic medical schools. This includes the number of applicants, the number accepted, and an affirmation of fair consideration and acceptance of licensing exam scores. The Secretary will publish this information online, with a rule of construction against federalizing medical education or mandating student acceptance. Hospitals failing to submit this information will face a reduction in Medicare payments.",
