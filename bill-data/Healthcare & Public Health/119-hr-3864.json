    "summary": "This bill, the Protecting Health Care for All Patients Act of 2025, aims to prohibit the use of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and similar measures in coverage and payment determinations within federal healthcare programs. It amends the Social Security Act to prevent discrimination based on age or disability in healthcare evaluations and extends this prohibition to Medicaid, CHIP, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare Part D. It also modifies the funding for the Prevention and Public Health Fund and mandates a report on the impact of QALYs on individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.",
