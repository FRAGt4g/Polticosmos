    "summary": "This bill, known as the End Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Providers Act, aims to prohibit the use of federal funds for entities that perform, provide referrals for, or fund abortions. Exceptions are made for abortions resulting from rape or incest, or when a physician certifies the mother's life is in danger. The bill's provisions apply unless explicitly excluded by future legislation and take effect 60 days after enactment. It does not affect any existing abortion-related limitations in appropriations acts.",
