    "summary": "This bill, the Lung Cancer Screening and Prevention Act of 2025, aims to expand Medicare coverage for lung cancer screening tests. It amends the Social Security Act to allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to cover additional FDA-approved lung cancer screening tests as preventive services, subject to appropriate frequency and payment limits. The bill also specifies the process for making national coverage determinations for these tests, without requiring a determination related to preventative services.",
