    "summary": "The Stop Antiabortion Disinformation Act (SAD Act) aims to prohibit deceptive advertising related to abortion services. The bill targets entities, particularly Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs), that misrepresent their services or disseminate false information about abortion and contraception. It grants the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) authority to enforce these prohibitions, including issuing regulations, imposing penalties, and bringing civil actions against violators. Violations are treated as unfair or deceptive acts under existing FTC law.",
