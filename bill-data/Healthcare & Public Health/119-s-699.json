    "summary": "This bill, the \"Purchased and Referred Care Improvement Act of 2025,\" amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to address liability for payment of charges related to purchased/referred care services for Native Americans. It clarifies that patients are not liable for these costs and mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish procedures for patient reimbursement.  It also requires updates to relevant manuals and contracts to reflect these changes, substituting \"purchased/referred care\" for \"contract health services.\"",
