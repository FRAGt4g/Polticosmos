    "summary": "The End Price Gouging for Medications Act (S. 1753) mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish annual reference prices for prescription drugs based on the lowest retail list prices in specified countries. These reference prices would apply to various Federal health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, limiting the retail price of drugs. The bill also requires drug manufacturers to offer drugs at the reference price to all individuals, regardless of insurance status. Non-compliance results in civil penalties, with collected funds allocated to drug research and development. The bill aims to increase healthcare access and reduce drug costs.",
