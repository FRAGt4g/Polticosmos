    "summary": "The Vaccines in Trial and Liability Act of 2025 (VITAL Act) aims to criminalize fraudulent statements and concealment of material information by medical research companies/sponsors during clinical vaccine trials. It amends existing United States Code and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to revoke liability protections and allow civil actions if fraud is found, especially with COVID-19 vaccines. The bill also establishes a hearing process for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine fraud and outlines procedures for manufacturers/sponsors to refute such determinations.",
