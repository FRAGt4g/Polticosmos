    "summary": "The Fentanyl Awareness for Children and Teens in Schools Act (FACTS Act) aims to combat synthetic opioid misuse and overdose among youth. It establishes partnership programs between schools and public health agencies, authorizes grants for education and prevention efforts, and creates an interagency task force. The bill amends existing education and public health legislation to include training for school personnel, data collection improvements, and the availability of naloxone in health centers. It also directs surveys to include questions about synthetic opioid use and calls for an evaluation of state overdose reporting systems.",
