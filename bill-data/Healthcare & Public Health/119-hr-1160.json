    "summary": "The Health Care Provider Shortage Minimization Act of 2025 aims to address physician shortages by clarifying the tax treatment of locum tenens physicians and advanced care practitioners. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to classify these healthcare providers as independent contractors, rather than employees, for tax purposes. This would apply to services performed after the bill's enactment and seeks to increase access to healthcare, particularly in underserved areas.",
