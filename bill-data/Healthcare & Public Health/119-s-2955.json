    "summary": "This bill, the Forced Abortion Prevention and Accountability Act, aims to establish federal penalties for administering abortion-inducing drugs to pregnant women without their informed consent, particularly if the drug is shipped across state lines. It sets potential fines and imprisonment terms, and allows for civil actions by affected women, including monetary damages and attorney's fees. The bill defines key terms like \"abortion,\" \"abortion-inducing drug,\" and \"informed consent,\" and revises related sections of the United States Code.",
