    "summary": "The Leveraging Integrity and Verification of Eligibility for Beneficiaries Act (LIVE Beneficiaries Act) amends Title XIX of the Social Security Act to require states to verify eligibility for medical assistance recipients. Specifically, it mandates quarterly reviews of the Death Master File to identify deceased enrollees. Upon confirmation, states must disenroll deceased individuals, cease payments (except for services prior to death), and reinstate coverage if errors are made.  The bill aims to ensure accurate payment and prevent fraud in the Medicaid program.",
