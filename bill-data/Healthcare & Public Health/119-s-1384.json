    "summary": "The Abortion Funding Awareness Act of 2025 mandates that states report information on Medicaid payments made to abortion providers. States must submit reports specifying payment amounts, purposes, comparisons to prior years, abortion numbers, gestational ages, and methods used. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to compile and publish these state reports, along with a summary, for Congress and the public. The bill also defines key terms like \"abortion provider\" and \"Medicaid payment\" and makes conforming amendments to the Social Security Act.",
