    "summary": "The 'Healthcare Freedom and Choice Act' (H.R. 379) is a bill designed to nullify a specific federal rule. Introduced by Representative Carter of Georgia, it targets the final interagency rule published on April 3, 2024, which regulated Short-Term, Limited-Duration Insurance (STLDI). The bill declares that this rule shall have no force or effect. By doing so, it seeks to reverse the limitations imposed on these health insurance plans by the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury, aiming to preserve broader access to and availability of STLDI for consumers.",
