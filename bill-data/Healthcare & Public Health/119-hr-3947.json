    "summary": "The 'Easy Enrollment in Health Care Act' aims to streamline enrollment in health insurance affordability programs, primarily through integration with federal income tax returns. It allows taxpayers to consent to the disclosure of tax information to determine eligibility for programs like Medicaid, CHIP, and those under the Affordable Care Act. The bill establishes procedures for enrollment, data sharing, and eligibility determinations, including automatic enrollment in zero-premium health plans. It also seeks to modernize eligibility criteria, improve data infrastructure, and create an advisory committee, while the HHS conducts a study and makes recommendations.",
