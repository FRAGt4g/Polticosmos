    "summary": "The 'Removing Burdens From Organ Donation Act' aims to increase organ donation rates by requiring hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid to electronically notify organ procurement agencies when a potential donor is deceased or death is imminent. It mandates automated access to electronic health records, with exemptions for hospitals facing significant hardship, such as those in rural areas with limited internet access or experiencing cybersecurity attacks or natural disasters. The bill also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue guidance on best practices, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study evaluating the implementation of the new requirements.",
