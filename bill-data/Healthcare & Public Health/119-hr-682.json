    "summary": "The Heartbeat Protection Act of 2025 aims to amend Title 18 of the United States Code to prohibit abortions if a fetal heartbeat is detectable, or without first checking for a heartbeat.  Exceptions are made for the life of the mother, and in cases of rape or incest with specific reporting and documentation requirements. The bill defines key terms like 'abortion' and 'physician,' and sets fines and imprisonment for violations. It also outlines data retention policies and allows defendants to seek hearings before the State Medical Board.",
