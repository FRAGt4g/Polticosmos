    "summary": "The 'Increasing Access to Dental Insurance Act' aims to expand access to standalone dental plans available through the Federal Exchanges. The bill proposes amending Section 1321 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to prevent the Secretary from restricting enrollment in such plans based on whether an individual is also enrolled in a qualified health plan. This seeks to make dental insurance more accessible to a wider range of individuals by separating it from the requirement to also have health insurance.",
