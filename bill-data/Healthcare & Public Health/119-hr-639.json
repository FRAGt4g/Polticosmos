    "summary": "The 'Doctor Knows Best Act of 2025' aims to eliminate prior authorization requirements, utilization management techniques, and medical necessity reviews imposed by group health plans, health insurance issuers, and federal healthcare programs. Private insurers would be prohibited from these practices, and federal healthcare programs, including those under Chapter 89 of Title 5 and those under the Social Security Act, would follow suit starting January 1, 2026. The bill is intended to improve healthcare access by reducing administrative hurdles.",
