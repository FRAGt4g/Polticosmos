    "summary": "The Mobile Cancer Screening Act aims to improve cancer screening access, particularly in rural and underserved communities. The bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to eligible entities (hospitals, health centers, etc.) to support new mobile cancer screening units. Funds can be used for purchasing vehicles, acquiring technology, and covering operational costs. The bill prioritizes applicants with high potential impact on patient mortality and those serving underserved populations. It includes a matching funds requirement and mandates a report to Congress on the program's effectiveness. The bill authorizes appropriations of $15,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2027 through 2031.",
