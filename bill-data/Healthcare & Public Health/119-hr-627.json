    "summary": "The 'Ensuring Accurate and Complete Abortion Data Reporting Act of 2025' aims to improve abortion data collection and reporting to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It mandates states to submit abortion data as a condition for receiving Medicaid payments for family planning services. The bill also directs the CDC to create a standardized data collection system, including mandatory and voluntary questions, and requires the CDC to publish annual reports on the collected data, including cross-tabulations. This is done to improve public health analysis",
