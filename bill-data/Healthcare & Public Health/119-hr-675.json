    "summary": "The 'Domestic Security Using Production Partnerships and Lessons from Yesterday Act of 2025' mandates that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with other agencies, establishes a program to partner with domestic manufacturers to ensure the availability of qualified personal protective equipment (PPE) for public health emergencies.  The bill outlines requirements for these partnerships, including domestic manufacturing quotas and adherence to quality guidelines. It also prohibits federal, state, and local governments from using federal funds to procure PPE manufactured outside the U.S. Finally, it requires a report on the impact of changes to PPE requirements on frontline worker safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
