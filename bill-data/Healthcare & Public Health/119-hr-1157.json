    "summary": "The Affordable Care and Comprehensive Economic Support through Savings Act (ACCESS Act) amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to allow individuals enrolled in Exchange-provided high-deductible health plans to receive health savings account (HSA) contributions in lieu of reduced cost-sharing under the ACA. It also mandates that issuers offering certain plans provide HSA contributions upon election and offer a high-deductible plan as an alternative. The bill includes provisions for public education regarding HSAs and appropriates funds for payments. The changes would go into effect in 2026.",
