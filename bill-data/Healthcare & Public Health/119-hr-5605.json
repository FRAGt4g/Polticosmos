    "summary": "The Medical Device Nonvisual Accessibility Act of 2025 aims to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to establish nonvisual accessibility standards for medical devices with digital interfaces. The bill mandates that these devices, particularly those used in the home, be accessible to individuals who are blind or have low vision. It outlines standards, provides for waivers in cases of undue hardship, and requires the Secretary to develop training and regulations in consultation with relevant stakeholders. The bill defines covered devices, outlines what qualifies as a fundamental alteration, and emphasizes the importance of accessible user interfaces for home-use medical devices.",
