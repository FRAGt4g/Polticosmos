    "summary": "The 'Guaranteeing Religious Accommodation in Childhood Education Act' (GRACE Act) prohibits federal education funds from going to schools that require vaccinations unless they allow religious exemptions. Individuals (or their parents/guardians for children) can claim an exemption based on sincerely held religious beliefs without providing documentation. The bill defines key terms like 'child,' 'educational institution or agency,' and 'vaccination requirement.'",
