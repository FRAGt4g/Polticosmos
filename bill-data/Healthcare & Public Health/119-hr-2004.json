    "summary": "Tyler's Law directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on fentanyl testing in hospital emergency departments. The study will analyze the frequency, cost, benefits, and risks of such testing, as well as its impact on patient privacy and the patient-physician relationship. Following the study, the Secretary must issue guidance on whether routine fentanyl testing should be implemented, ensuring clinicians are aware of substances tested, and estimating effects on future overdose risk. The bill is in response to the opioid crisis.",
