    "summary": "The Access to Birth Control Act aims to amend the Public Health Service Act. It mandates that pharmacies provide FDA-approved contraception and related medications to customers without delay. Pharmacies must offer options like referrals or expedited ordering if a requested item isn't in stock. The bill also protects customers from intimidation, deception, and breaches of medical confidentiality. It provides civil penalties and private rights of action for violations. The bill highlights findings about the importance of family planning and access to contraception, and includes some limitations on pharmacies' obligations.",
