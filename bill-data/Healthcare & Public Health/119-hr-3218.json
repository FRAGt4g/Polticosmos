    "summary": "The Reproductive Data Privacy and Protection Act (HR 3218) amends Title 18 of the United States Code to safeguard reproductive and sexual health information. It restricts the use of intercepted communications and records in investigations or proceedings related to reproductive healthcare. The bill defines \"reproductive or sexual health information\" broadly to encompass various aspects of reproductive health and care, including abortion, contraception, and fertility treatments. It mandates government entities seeking access to customer communications to affirm that they will not use such information to investigate or prosecute individuals seeking, providing, or facilitating reproductive healthcare.",
