    "summary": "The 'Returning SBA to Main Street Act' mandates the Small Business Administration (SBA) to relocate at least 30% of its headquarters employees out of the Washington metropolitan area within a year of enactment. It requires the SBA to determine new duty stations to promote geographic diversity, including rural markets. The bill also reduces SBA headquarters office space and mandates reporting on employee relocation and telework. Finally it impacts pay based on new duty locations, and the bill supersedes other laws. No private citizens can claim the right to change a decision of the SBA because of this act.",
