It mandates a 3-year phase-in period for de novo banks to meet federal capital standards. It grants relief to de novo rural community banks by adjusting the Community Bank Leverage Ratio and provides agricultural loan authority for Federal savings associations. The bill also requires a study on the decline of de novo institutions and suggests ways to promote their establishment in underserved areas.",
