    "summary": "The Fighting Trade Cheats Act of 2025 aims to strengthen enforcement against customs fraud. It proposes increased civil penalties for fraudulent and grossly negligent violations of U.S. customs laws under the Tariff Act of 1930, including potential import bans. The bill also introduces a mechanism for private enforcement actions, allowing interested parties injured by customs fraud to sue for damages and equitable relief. Finally, it bars those found to have committed customs fraud from participating in the importer of record program.",
