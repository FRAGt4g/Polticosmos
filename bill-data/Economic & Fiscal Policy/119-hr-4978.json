    "summary": "The Secure Trade Act proposes to impose additional duties on imports into the United States, starting with a 10% ad valorem duty. It specifically targets trade with China, mandating higher tariffs on goods from China, with phased-in increases and potential for further increases based on dependence or unfair practices. The bill also includes provisions for the valuation of Chinese imports, review of foreign investments by countries of concern, and potential quotas and prohibitions on Chinese imports. The President can modify duties, with Congressional consultation required. ",
