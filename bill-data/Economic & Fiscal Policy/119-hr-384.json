    "summary": "This bill, the \"One Agency Act,\" seeks to consolidate federal antitrust enforcement. It proposes transferring all antitrust-related functions, personnel, actions, and funding from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the Department of Justice (DOJ), under the authority of the Attorney General. The legislation aims to eliminate overlapping jurisdiction, increase efficiency, and reduce uncertainty for businesses and consumers. It establishes a transition period for this transfer, after which the DOJ's Antitrust Division would have sole authority over federal antitrust investigations, litigation, and consent decrees, effectively ending the FTC's role in this area.",
