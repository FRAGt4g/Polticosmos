    "summary": "The Empowering Nonprofits Act (H.R. 314) mandates that for a five-year period, federal executive agencies must reduce cost-sharing requirements by 25% for grants awarded to certain nonprofit organizations. To be eligible, a nonprofit must be a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization located in a state, U.S. territory, or federally recognized Tribe where more than 20% of the population lives below the federal poverty line. The bill aims to ease the financial burden on these organizations, enabling them to better serve their communities in high-poverty areas.",
