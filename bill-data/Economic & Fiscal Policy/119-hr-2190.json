    "summary": "The Shareholder Political Transparency Act of 2025 mandates that publicly traded companies disclose their political spending. The bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require quarterly and annual reports detailing political expenditures, including independent expenditures, electioneering communications, and dues to trade organizations. These reports must be made available to shareholders and the public via the SEC's website. The SEC must also conduct an annual assessment of compliance and report to Congress. The bill aims to increase transparency around corporate political influence.",
