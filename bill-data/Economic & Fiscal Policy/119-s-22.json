    "summary": "The Strategic Withdrawal of Agencies for Meaningful Placement Act (SWAMP Act) mandates a competitive bidding process managed by the General Services Administration (GSA) for relocating the headquarters of Executive agencies outside of the Washington metropolitan area. The GSA will solicit proposals from states and their subdivisions, considering economic impact, relevant expertise, and national security implications.  Existing headquarters in the area are grandfathered in under specific restrictions. The bill outlines guidelines for the relocation process and allows for the use of proceeds from the sale of federal property to offset relocation costs, without authorizing additional funding.",
