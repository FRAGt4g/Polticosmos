    "summary": "The Import Security and Fairness Act amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to tighten rules on \"de minimis\" imports, which are duty-free shipments valued under $800. The bill eliminates this exemption for goods originating from or shipped from countries that are both nonmarket economies and on a priority intellectual property watch list. It also mandates that importers provide more detailed data to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for all de minimis shipments, including tariff classification and shipper identity. The act establishes civil penalties for violations and updates procedures for detaining merchandise, aiming to increase security and transparency.",
