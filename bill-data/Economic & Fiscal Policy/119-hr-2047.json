    "summary": "The Pink Tariffs Study Act (H.R. 2047) mandates a study by the Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. International Trade Commission, and the U.S. Trade Representative, to analyze the impact of U.S. tariffs. The study should assess whether tariffs are regressive, disproportionately affecting consumers based on income and household type, and if they exhibit gender bias, such as higher tariffs on women's clothing. Furthermore, the Secretary must determine if other categories of consumers and households are impacted by tariffs.",
