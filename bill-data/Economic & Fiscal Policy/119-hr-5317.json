    "summary": "The Community Bank Deposit Access Act of 2025 amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. It aims to prevent certain custodial deposits of well-capitalized insured depository institutions from being considered funds obtained through deposit brokers, up to 20% of the institution's total liabilities. It defines 'custodial deposit' and 'eligible institution,' providing exceptions for deposits managed by entities acting in a custodial or fiduciary capacity. The bill also restricts the interest rates that covered insured depository institutions can pay on broker deposits and custodial deposits accepted while not well capitalized.",
