    "summary": "This bill, the Currency Optimization, Innovation, and National Savings Act of 2025, aims to reduce taxpayer spending by suspending the production of new one-cent coins (pennies) for a decade. It acknowledges that enough pennies have been minted and production is financially unsustainable. An exception is made to continue producing pennies for numismatic collectors, with sales costs covering production. The bill clarifies that existing pennies remain legal tender.",
