It requires the Board to publicly disclose stress test scenarios at least 30 days beforehand. Furthermore, the bill prohibits climate-related stress tests for nonbank financial companies and mandates the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct triennial reviews of the stress tests' effectiveness.",
