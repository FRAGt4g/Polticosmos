    "summary": "This bill, the Advancing the Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program for Small Financial Institutions Act, aims to establish a program within the Department of the Treasury to pair large financial institutions or financial agents with small financial institutions. The goal is to prepare small institutions to act as financial agents or improve their service capabilities. The Secretary of the Treasury will oversee the program, hold outreach events, and potentially exclude institutions. The Office of Minority and Women Inclusion will report on the program's progress to Congress. The Act defines key terms like 'financial agent,' 'large financial institution,' and 'small financial institution'. The bill takes effect 90 days after enactment.",
