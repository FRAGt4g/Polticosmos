    "summary": "This bill, the \"Capping Excessive Awarding of SBLC Entrants Act\" (CEASE Act), aims to limit the number of small business lending companies (SBLCs) authorized to make loans under section 7 of the Small Business Act. It amends the Act to stipulate that the Administrator shall ensure no more than 16 non-profit SBLCs are authorized at any given time. The goal is likely to prevent an over-saturation within the SBLC market.",
