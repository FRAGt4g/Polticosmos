    "summary": "The Bank Competition Modernization Act amends existing laws to ensure competitive factors are considered when evaluating acquisitions, mergers, and other transactions within the banking industry. It mandates consideration of various financial entities, including depository institutions, holding companies, industrial loan companies, and nonbank financial companies, when assessing competitive impacts.  The bill also revises considerations for transactions involving entities with less than $10 billion in assets, ensuring fair competition and preventing monopolization.",
