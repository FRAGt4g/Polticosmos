    "summary": "The 'For Sale Act of 2025' mandates the Administrator of General Services to sell specified underutilized Federal buildings, including the Department of Agriculture South Building and the Hubert H. Humphrey Federal Building. Federal agencies located in these buildings must relocate within 18 months of enactment. Sales must occur within two years of vacancy, with a prohibition on sales to foreign persons or entities. Net proceeds from the sales will fund implementation costs, with any excess going towards deficit reduction. The bill also prohibits additional property purchases or leases as part of the consolidation process and exempts the sales from certain regulations, including the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.",
