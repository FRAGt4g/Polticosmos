    "summary": "The Gold Reserve Transparency Act of 2025 mandates a comprehensive audit of all U.S. gold reserves. This includes assaying, inventorying, and auditing locations where the gold is stored. The Comptroller General will hire an independent auditor to examine security measures, encumbrances (leases, swaps), transactions (sales, purchases), and all gold interests, including those held by third parties like the IMF or BIS. Reports detailing these findings, with limited public redactions for security specifics, are to be submitted to Congress and made publicly available online. The Comptroller General has full access to relevant records and Treasury cooperation is required.",
