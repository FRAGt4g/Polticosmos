It mandates the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the appropriate federal banking agency to produce reports for Congress detailing the basis for determinations, actions taken, potential effects, any mismanagement, and supervisory shortcomings. The reports aim to increase accountability and provide insights into the failures of financial institutions.",
