    "summary": "This bill proposes to impose additional duties on imported goods into the United States. Initially, a 10% ad valorem duty would be applied. This duty would then be adjusted annually based on the U.S. trade balance in goods and services. If there's a deficit, the duty increases by 5%. If there's a surplus or balance, the duty decreases by 5% (but cannot go below $0). These duties are in addition to any existing import duties.",
