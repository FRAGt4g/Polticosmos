    "summary": "The 'Make Sense Not Cents Act' aims to eliminate the production and issuance of 1-cent coins. It amends Title 31 of the United States Code and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reflect this change. The bill explicitly states that existing 1-cent coins remain legal tender and reaffirms Congress's authority over currency. This includes consequential changes related to references to cent coins in existing statues.",
