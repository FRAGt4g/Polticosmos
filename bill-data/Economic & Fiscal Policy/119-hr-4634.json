    "summary": "This bill, the Debt Ceiling Reform Act, proposes a new process for addressing the US debt ceiling. It introduces a mechanism allowing the Treasury Secretary to certify the need for continued borrowing, triggering a Congressional review period. Congress then has 45 days to pass a joint resolution disapproving the Secretary's action; if they fail to do so, the suspension of the debt ceiling can be extended for up to two years. The bill outlines expedited procedures for consideration in both the House and Senate, including limitations on debate and amendment. Additionally, it modifies reporting requirements regarding debt information.",
