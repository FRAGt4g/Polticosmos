    "summary": "The Halting Uncertain Methods and Practices in Supervision Act of 2025 (HUMPS Act) aims to amend the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978. It mandates the Council to recommend updates to the CAMELS rating system (Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to market risk).  The bill seeks to establish clear, objective criteria for each CAMELS component, revise their weighting, and ensure transparency in determining composite ratings. It also directs regulatory agencies to issue rules based on these recommendations and includes changes to the definition of 'well managed' for bank holding companies.",
