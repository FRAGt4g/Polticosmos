    "summary": "The \"Prove It Act of 2025\" aims to increase transparency in federal regulatory decisions impacting small businesses. It amends Title 5 of the United States Code to require agencies to consider potential indirect costs on small entities when conducting initial regulatory flexibility analyses. The bill establishes review procedures for certifications, allowing the Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel to review agency determinations and potentially require further analysis. It also mandates the publication of guidance documents and allows for comments. Additionally, the bill strengthens review processes for existing rules and outlines consequences for failing to review regulations.",
