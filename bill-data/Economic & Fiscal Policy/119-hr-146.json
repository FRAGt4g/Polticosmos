    "summary": "H.R. 146, the \"Prohibition on IOER Act of 2025,\" proposes an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act. The bill aims to stop Federal Reserve banks from paying interest on the excess reserves held by depository institutions. Currently, the Federal Reserve uses Interest on Excess Reserves (IOER) as a primary monetary policy tool to influence short-term interest rates. This legislation would restrict interest payments to only the reserves that banks are legally required to maintain. By eliminating payments on excess reserves, the bill would alter the incentives for banks to park money at the Fed, impacting the financial system.",
