    "summary": "The 'Community Bank Leverage Improvement and Flexibility for Transparency Act' (Community Bank LIFT Act) amends the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act to adjust the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR). It increases the asset threshold for qualifying community banks and lowers the allowed leverage ratio. The bill also mandates a review of the CBLR by federal agencies, focusing on how to encourage more banks to adopt the framework and reduce regulatory burden. A report with recommendations is required within 150 days.",
