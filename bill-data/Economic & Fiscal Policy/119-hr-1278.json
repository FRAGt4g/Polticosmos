The goal is to reduce costs for taxpayers. The Director must consult with the Secretary, conduct studies, and get input from stakeholders. Changes must maintain the same diameter and weight and work in most coin acceptors. The Director must notify Congress before implementing changes, which can be blocked by a joint resolution of disapproval.",
