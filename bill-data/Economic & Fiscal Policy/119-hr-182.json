    "summary": "The \"Default Prevention Act\" establishes a procedure for the Treasury Department to manage payments if the U.S. hits its statutory debt limit. To avert a default, the bill mandates a tiered prioritization system. Tier I, the highest priority, includes payments for the national debt, Social Security, and Medicare. Tier II includes Department of Defense and veterans' obligations. All other government payments, including congressional salaries (the lowest tier), would only be made if funds are available after higher-tier obligations are fulfilled. The bill also mandates weekly reporting to Congress on these payments.",
