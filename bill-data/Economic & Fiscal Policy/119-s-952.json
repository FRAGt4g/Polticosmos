    "summary": "This bill, S.952, aims to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to standardize how whiskies are classified. It proposes a uniform 8-digit subheading for all whiskies under Chapter 22, replacing existing subheadings. The bill also instructs the United States International Trade Commission to add statistical suffixes to this new subheading, differentiating whiskies based on type (Irish, Scotch, Bourbon, Rye, Other) and container size. The changes are slated to take effect 15 days after the bill's enactment.",
