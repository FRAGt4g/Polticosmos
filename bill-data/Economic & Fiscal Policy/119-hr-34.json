    "summary": "The \"Land And Social Security Optimization Act\" (LASSO Act) proposes a new funding stream for Social Security. It directs that 10% of annual revenues generated from public lands, including those managed by the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service, be deposited into the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Trust Fund. The bill explicitly prohibits raising fees on land use to generate this revenue and ensures that existing payments to states, tribes, and local governments are not reduced. This legislation aims to bolster the Social Security system by redirecting a portion of federal land revenue.",
