    "summary": "This bill, the Capacity Building for Business Districts Pilot Program Act of 2025, amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to establish a pilot program. This program will provide grants to organizations that offer technical assistance, capacity building, and related services to business districts, particularly in low-income, rural, minority, and Native communities. The Secretary of Commerce will administer the program and prioritize applicants serving distressed communities and those with the capacity to serve multiple states or geographies within a state. The bill defines key terms like 'business district,' 'business district organization,' and 'capacity building,' and mandates reporting on grant usage and outcomes.",
