    "summary": "The Debt Ceiling Reform Act proposes a process to prevent the United States from defaulting on its financial obligations. It establishes a mechanism for the Secretary of the Treasury to notify Congress of the need to suspend the debt ceiling. Congress can then act on a joint resolution to disapprove the suspension, otherwise, the suspension takes effect for a specified period. The bill outlines expedited procedures for consideration of these joint resolutions in both the House and Senate. It also makes a conforming amendment and requires additional information on debt reporting.",
