    "summary": "This bill, known as the '$2.50 for America\u2019s 250th Act,' proposes the minting and issuing of $2.50 coins to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. It mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to issue circulating $2.50 coins, contingent on technical and economic feasibility, and allows for numismatic versions. The coins' designs will initially mirror the 1926 Sesquicentennial coin, with potential for new designs every 5 years for circulating coins and every 2 years for numismatic coins. The bill also expresses the sense of Congress that the coins should be issued by July 4, 2026, or as soon as possible.",
