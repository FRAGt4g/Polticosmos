    "summary": "The bill, titled the Small Business Procurement and Utilization Reform Act of 2025, aims to amend the Small Business Act. It focuses on incorporating requirements related to new small business entrants into the federal scorecard program, which evaluates agencies' efforts to meet small business procurement goals. The bill mandates the inclusion of data on new small business entrants, including those owned by specific demographics (veterans, HUBZone businesses, disadvantaged individuals, and women), in the scorecard assessment. It also defines \"new small business entrant\" and \"scorecard\" within the context of the act and clarifies compliance.",
