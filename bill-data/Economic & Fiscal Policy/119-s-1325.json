    "summary": "The Foreign Pollution Fee Act of 2025 proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code to impose a fee on imported products based on their production-related pollution intensity. The bill aims to level the playing field for American manufacturers by addressing cost advantages of foreign producers operating under weaker environmental standards. It defines key terms, outlines fee calculation methods, establishes an Advisory Committee, and allows for international partnership agreements to reduce fees for compliant countries. The fee structure considers factors such as country of origin, pollution levels, and potential evasion attempts.",
