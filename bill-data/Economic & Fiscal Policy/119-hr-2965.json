    "summary": "The Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act of 2025 aims to reduce the regulatory burden on small businesses. It mandates that the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) ensures the agency's regulatory budget for small businesses is zero in fiscal year 2026 and beyond. This includes all costs associated with new, modified, or repealed rules.  Furthermore, it requires the SBA's Chief Counsel to submit an annual report to Congress detailing the impact of other federal agencies' regulations on small businesses.",
