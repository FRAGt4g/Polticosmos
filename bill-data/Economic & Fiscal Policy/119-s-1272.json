    "summary": "The Trade Review Act of 2025 mandates that the President notify Congress within 48 hours of imposing or increasing a duty on imported goods, including the rationale and potential impact on U.S. businesses and consumers.  Duties are limited to a 60-day duration unless approved by a joint resolution of Congress. Congress can also disapprove duties via a joint resolution, after which the duty ceases to be enforced. This act does not apply to anti-dumping and countervailing duties.",
