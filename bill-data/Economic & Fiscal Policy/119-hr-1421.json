    "summary": "The 'Make American Flags in America Act of 2025' mandates that all US flags displayed or procured by federal agencies must be manufactured entirely in the United States.  It amends Title 4 of the United States Code to prohibit federal agencies from displaying or purchasing flags not made in the US, with different implementation timelines for display and procurement. The bill also requires the Federal Trade Commission to study and report on the enforcement of country-of-origin labeling for US flags and recommend improvements.",
