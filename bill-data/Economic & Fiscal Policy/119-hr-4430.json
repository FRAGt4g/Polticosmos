    "summary": "H.R. 4430 aims to change the criteria for companies to be considered \"well-known seasoned issuers\" under federal securities laws. Specifically, it proposes lowering the required aggregate market value of voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates to $75,000,000. This adjustment would make it easier for companies to qualify for this designation, potentially impacting how they issue securities to the public.",
