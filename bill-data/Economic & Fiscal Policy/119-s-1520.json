    "summary": "The Investment Accelerator Act of 2025 aims to establish the United States Investment Accelerator within the Department of Commerce. This office, in coordination with the Treasury Department and the White House, will focus on facilitating and accelerating large-scale investments in the U.S. by navigating regulatory processes, reducing burdens, increasing resource access, promoting research collaborations, and working with state governments to attract investment. The bill also tasks the Accelerator with coordinating the CHIPS Program Office and identifying opportunities to assist both foreign and domestic investors. An Executive Director appointed by the Secretary of Commerce will oversee these activities and report annually to relevant congressional committees.",
