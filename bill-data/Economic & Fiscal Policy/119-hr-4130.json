    "summary": "The Small Business Relief Act amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to exclude qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors when calculating the number of security holders for the mandatory registration threshold. This is intended to ease the regulatory burden on small businesses by potentially allowing them to have more investors without triggering certain registration requirements. The bill also specifies that the general exemptive authority of the Act does not apply to this amendment.",
