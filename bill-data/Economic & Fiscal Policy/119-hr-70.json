    "summary": "The 'No SmartPay for Anti-2A Companies Act' (H.R. 70) would prohibit the General Services Administration from awarding new federal contracts under the SmartPay program to commercial payment system providers. This prohibition applies if the provider's payment processing agency uses a specific merchant category code (MCC) to classify sales at gun retailers. The bill aims to prevent the federal government from contracting with financial companies that have implemented these special codes, which are viewed by the bill's supporters as a method to surveil or restrict Second Amendment rights. The measure would not affect contracts awarded before the bill's enactment.",
