    "summary": "This bill aims to encourage the formation of new banks by reducing initial regulatory hurdles. It establishes a 3-year phase-in period for new depository institutions to meet federal capital requirements and streamlines the process for them to alter their business plans. The act provides specific relief for new rural community banks by setting a lower initial leverage ratio. It also expands the authority of Federal savings associations to provide agricultural loans and mandates a federal study to investigate the decline in new bank formation and propose solutions, particularly for underserved areas.",
