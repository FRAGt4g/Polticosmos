The bill defines 'covered Federal benefit program', 'enhanced gross income' and specifies the requirements of the EIVP, which includes automated data matching for unreported income, analyzing applicant-permissioned deposit data, and consolidating data to avoid double-counting. The goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of benefit programs.",
