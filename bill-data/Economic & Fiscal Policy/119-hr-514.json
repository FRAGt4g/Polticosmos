    "summary": "The bill, titled the Strategic Withdrawal of Agencies for Meaningful Placement Act (SWAMP Act), mandates a competitive bidding process for relocating the headquarters of Executive agencies outside of the Washington metropolitan area. The General Services Administrator (GSA) will oversee the process, allowing states and their subdivisions to submit proposals. The GSA will consider factors like economic impact, relevant expertise, and national security implications when selecting a new location. The bill specifies exceptions and conditions for existing headquarters in the Washington area, and allows the GSA to use proceeds from building sales to offset relocation costs.",
