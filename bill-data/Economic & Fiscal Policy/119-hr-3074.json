    "summary": "The 'Common Cents Act' aims to eliminate the production of the penny, with exceptions for numismatic collectors. It mandates rounding cash transactions to the nearest five cents, rounding down for amounts ending in 1, 2, 6, or 7 cents and up for amounts ending in 3, 4, 8, or 9 cents.  Exceptions are made for transactions totaling $.01 or $.02 (rounded to $.05) and for non-cash payment methods. The changes take effect one year after enactment.",
