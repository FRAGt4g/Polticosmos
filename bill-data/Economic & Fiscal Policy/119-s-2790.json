    "summary": "The Resilient Tire Supply and Jobs Act aims to incentivize the use of retreaded tires. It introduces a tax credit for businesses purchasing retreaded tires and mandates federal agencies to prioritize retreaded tires for their vehicle fleets when available. The bill specifies the credit amount, defines qualified tires, and sets a termination date for the credit. It also includes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code and the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement these measures. The bill's intention is to promote economic benefits from retreading by creating jobs and by supporting a more sustainable supply of tires.",
