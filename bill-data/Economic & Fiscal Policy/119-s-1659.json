    "summary": "The Bankruptcy Administration Improvement Act of 2025 aims to improve the bankruptcy system. Key provisions include increasing compensation for Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustees, adjusting fee allocations to support the United States Trustee System Fund, and extending the terms of certain temporary bankruptcy judge offices. The bill also addresses quarterly fees in Chapter 11 cases. The increase in trustee compensation and the fee adjustments are set to take effect for cases or disbursements occurring after the date of enactment, while the extension of judge terms should bolster existing judicial staffing.",
