    "summary": "The Auto Bailout Accident Victims Recovery Act of 2025 aims to provide compensation to individuals who filed claims related to accidents involving General Motors vehicles before June 1, 2009, and arising from the 2009 government bailout. The bill waives the statute of limitations for relevant cases and mandates the United States pay \"just compensation\" to eligible claimants, based on their claims in the Motors Liquidation Company bankruptcy. It defines \"eligible claim,\" \"eligible claimant,\" and \"eligible complaint,\" and outlines the method for calculating compensation, including interest and legal fees.",
