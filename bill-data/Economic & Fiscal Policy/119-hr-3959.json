    "summary": "This bill, the Protecting Private Job Creators Act, aims to exempt quotations of fixed-income securities from certain regulatory requirements under Rule 15c2-11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The bill addresses concerns about the application of this rule to fixed-income markets, citing the differences between these markets and OTC equity markets, and the impact of the rule on businesses' ability to raise capital. It references prior actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and seeks to codify an exception for fixed-income securities.",
