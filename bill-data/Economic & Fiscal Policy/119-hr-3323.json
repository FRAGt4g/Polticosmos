    "summary": "The Helping Startups Continue To Grow Act (H.R. 3323) proposed by Mr. Steil and Mrs. Wagner aims to update the definition of an \"emerging growth company.\"  It amends sections of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which focuses on raising the threshold for emerging growth company status from $1 billion to $3 billion in revenue/capital and extends the time frame for such status. The bill's intent is to provide more companies with access to the benefits of being an emerging growth company.",
