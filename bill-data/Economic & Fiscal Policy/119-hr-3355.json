    "summary": "This bill, the \"Ensuring U.S. Authority over U.S. Banking Regulations Act\", mandates that federal banking agencies provide notice, testimony, and economic analysis to congressional committees before implementing rules based on recommendations from non-governmental international organizations, especially those related to banking supervision and climate-related financial risk. These rules must have a significant economic impact to trigger such requirements. The bill also requires reports on climate-related interactions with relevant international organizations. It aims to increase transparency and oversight over financial regulations.",
