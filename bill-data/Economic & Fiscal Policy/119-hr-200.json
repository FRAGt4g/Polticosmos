    "summary": "The \"Federal Freeze Act\" proposes a one-year hiring freeze for most federal agency positions, preventing them from exceeding their employee counts as of the bill's enactment date. Exceptions are allowed for appointments deemed essential for law enforcement, public safety, or national security. The bill also freezes the annual basic pay for federal employees for one year. Furthermore, it mandates a phased reduction in the federal workforce, requiring agencies to reduce staffing by 2% within two years and 5% within three years, aiming to shrink the size and cost of the federal government.",
