    "summary": "This bill proposes a constitutional amendment to limit the total federal debt. Initially, the debt cannot exceed 130% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a cap that will decrease annually by 1% until it reaches 120%. This limit can be overridden for a fiscal year with a three-fifths vote in both the House and Senate. The President must submit budgets that adhere to this limit. The provisions can be waived during a declared war or a specifically declared military conflict. The amendment would take effect in the third fiscal year following ratification by the states.",
