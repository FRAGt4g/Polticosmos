    "summary": "The Bankruptcy Administration Improvement Act of 2025 aims to improve the bankruptcy system. Key provisions include increasing compensation for Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustees, modifying the distribution of bankruptcy fees, and extending the terms of certain temporary bankruptcy judge offices. The bill cites the need to support the self-funding nature of the bankruptcy system and ensure adequate resources for trustees and judges dealing with increasing caseloads. It makes no changes to the filing fee, also noting it doesn't impair district courts authority to waive filing fees for indigent individuals.",
