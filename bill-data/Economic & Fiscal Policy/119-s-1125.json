    "summary": "The Cultural Trade Promotion Act aims to promote exports from creative industries and occupations. The bill defines these industries and occupations, focusing on those that contribute to economic growth and opportunities tied to design, crafts, music, visual and media arts, performing arts, and expressions of culture. The Act amends existing legislation to include microenterprises within export promotion efforts, emphasizes exports of Native Hawaiian arts and crafts, and directs agencies to improve access to international shipping services for microenterprises. It also calls for collaboration and consideration of creative industries in trade and tourism initiatives.",
