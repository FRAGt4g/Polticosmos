    "summary": "This bill, the Financial Institution Regulatory Tailoring Enhancement Act (H.R. 3230), amends various sections of existing law to increase the asset thresholds at which financial institutions are subject to certain regulatory requirements. Specifically, it raises the $10 billion threshold mentioned in the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act to $50 billion. This would change the regulatory landscape for many financial institutions.",
