    "summary": "The Pay Down the Debt Act (S. 2187) aims to reduce the national debt by rescinding federal grant funds that are not accepted by state or local governments. Specifically, the bill mandates that if a state or local government declines a federal grant, the corresponding funds will be rescinded from the relevant appropriation account. These rescinded funds are then to be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury, solely for the purpose of deficit reduction.",
