    "summary": "The Investments in Innovation Act of 2025 aims to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. It proposes excluding certain investments in socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses from the leverage limit calculation for small business investment companies. This encourages investment in these types of businesses, with limitations on the maximum outstanding leverage allowed depending on the company's private capital and whether companies are under common control. Companies must certify that at least 50% of investments are in eligible entities to qualify.",
