    "summary": "The Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2025 directs the Comptroller General to conduct a full audit of the Federal Reserve System, including its Board of Governors and reserve banks, within one year of enactment. A detailed report on the findings must be submitted to Congress shortly thereafter. The bill enhances oversight by repealing existing legal restrictions that currently limit the scope of audits of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions, transactions with foreign governments, and Federal Open Market Committee operations. The primary goal is to increase transparency in the nation's central banking system.",
