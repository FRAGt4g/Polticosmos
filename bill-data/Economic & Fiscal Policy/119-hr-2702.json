    "summary": "This bill, the Financial Integrity and Regulation Management Act (FIRM Act), aims to limit the influence of \"reputational risk\" in the supervision of depository institutions by federal banking agencies. It seeks to prevent agencies from considering negative publicity when regulating these institutions, arguing this approach can lead to unfair treatment and political weaponization. The bill mandates the removal of any reference to reputational risk from agency guidelines and prohibits actions based on it, requiring reports to Congress on the implementation of these changes.",
