    "summary": "The 'Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2025' (SCRUB Act) mandates a review process to identify and repeal existing federal rules deemed overly costly. It establishes 'Cut-Go' procedures, requiring agencies to offset the costs of new rules by repealing others. The bill directs the DOGE (likely the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs) to review regulations, prioritizing those that are major, old, or impose significant burdens. It also includes plans for future rule reviews and provisions for judicial review.",
