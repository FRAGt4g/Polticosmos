    "summary": "The \"Regulation Reduction Act of 2025\" requires federal agencies to repeal three existing regulations for every new one they issue. For \"major rules,\" the cost of the new rule must be less than or equal to the cost of the repealed regulations, as certified by the Office of Management and Budget. This requirement applies to rules imposing costs on private citizens, companies, and state or local governments, but excludes internal agency policies. The Act also mandates that all agencies review their existing rules and report to Congress on any that are costly, ineffective, duplicative, or outdated.",
