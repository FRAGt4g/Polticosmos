    "summary": "This bill, the Reducing Expensive Departments & Unnecessary Civil Employees Act (REDUCE Act), mandates executive branch agencies to review and report on redundant positions within 30 days of the bill's enactment. It limits hiring to one new employee for every four departures until overall agency staffing is reduced to 80% of its current level. Agencies must also develop plans for reductions in force or reorganization. However, positions or components deemed critical to national security, public safety, law enforcement, or immigration enforcement are exempt.",
