    "summary": "This bill, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2025, amends the Financial Stability Act of 2010. It requires the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to consider alternative approaches before determining that a U.S. nonbank financial company should be supervised by the Federal Reserve. Specifically, the FSOC must consult with the company and its primary regulator to determine if alternative actions or plans are insufficient to mitigate financial stability risks before imposing heightened supervision.",
