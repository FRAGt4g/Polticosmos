    "summary": "The \"Assisting Small Businesses Not Fraudsters Act\" amends the Small Business Act to prevent individuals convicted of financial misconduct related to government loans and grants from receiving further financial assistance from the Small Business Administration (SBA). This includes associates of small businesses and the businesses themselves if an associate has such a conviction. The bill defines \"associate,\" \"covered loan or grant,\" and \"finally convicted,\" and clarifies that the new prohibition does not apply retroactively to existing contracts.",
