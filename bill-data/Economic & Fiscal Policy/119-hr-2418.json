    "summary": "The Federal Reserve Regulatory Oversight Act aims to bring the non-monetary policy related administrative costs of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors under the control of Congressional appropriations. The bill mandates that the Board and Federal Reserve Banks collect assessments and fees to cover these costs, which would be deposited as offsetting collections. It defines 'monetary policy' and 'non-monetary policy related administrative costs,' specifying the latter to include expenses related to supervision and regulation. The amendments would take effect October 1, 2025.",
