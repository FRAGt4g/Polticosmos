    "summary": "The Regulation Decimation Act mandates that federal agencies repeal ten existing regulations before issuing a new one. For major rules, the cost of the new rule must be less than or equal to the cost of the repealed rules, and the Office of Management and Budget must certify this. Agencies must also report to Congress on costly, ineffective, or outdated regulations and the President must issue a report on rule reduction. The Act aims to reduce the burden of regulations.",
