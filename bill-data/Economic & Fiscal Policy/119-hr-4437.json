    "summary": "This bill, the Supervisory Modifications for Appropriate Risk-based Testing Act of 2025 (SMART Act), aims to reduce regulatory burdens on well-managed and well-capitalized financial institutions (both insured depository institutions and insured credit unions) with $6 billion or less in consolidated assets. It mandates alternating limited-scope examinations and allows for combined examinations (safety and soundness, consumer compliance, and cybersecurity) upon request. The bill grants exceptions for institutions under enforcement action or those acquired since their last full-scope examination. It directs federal agencies to issue rules to implement the changes and clarifies that it doesn't limit existing oversight powers. ",
