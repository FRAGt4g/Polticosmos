    "summary": "This bill, the \"1071 Repeal to Protect Small Business Lending Act,\" aims to eliminate data collection requirements for small business loans under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. It argues these requirements increase compliance costs, potentially hindering access to credit, particularly for smaller financial institutions. The bill would repeal Section 704B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and make conforming amendments to related legislation.",
