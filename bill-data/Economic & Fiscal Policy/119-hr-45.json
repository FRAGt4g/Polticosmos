    "summary": "This bill, the Firearm Industry Non-Discrimination (FIND) Act, prohibits the federal government from entering into contracts with companies that have policies discriminating against the firearm or ammunition industry. To receive a federal contract, a prime contractor must certify that it does not, and will not, discriminate against a firearm entity. This requirement also extends to first-tier subcontracts valued at over 10% of the prime contract. Violations would result in contract termination and potential debarment. The bill defines discrimination to include refusing services based on category-wide assessments rather than individual, case-by-case financial risk analysis.",
