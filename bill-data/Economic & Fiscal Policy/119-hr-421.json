    "summary": "This bill, the \"Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act,\" aims to reduce the regulatory burden on small businesses by amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act. It expands the types of federal rules requiring analysis to include those with indirect economic effects, those affecting tribal organizations, and land management plans. The bill mandates agencies to conduct more detailed analyses of a rule's impact, considering cumulative effects and both adverse and beneficial outcomes. It enhances the power of the Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy and requires periodic review of rules. It also waives civil fines for first-time paperwork violations by small businesses.",
