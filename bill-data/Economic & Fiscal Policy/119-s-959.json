    "summary": "The Tariff Transparency Act of 2025 mandates the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate and report on the impact of duties and the threat of duties on imports from Mexico and Canada. It focuses on the effects on consumer prices (food, energy, critical minerals, vehicles, shelter, medical goods, apparel, consumer electronics, farming inputs, and defense manufacturing) caused by proposed tariffs by President Trump. The report also assesses the consequences of the uncertainty surrounding trade relationships, including effects on business investment, job creation, and small businesses; it examines any retaliatory actions taken by Mexico and Canada. The report is due to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment.",
