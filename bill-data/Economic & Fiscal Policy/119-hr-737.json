This includes reports 30 days before reaching the limit (detailing intended measures and costs), daily reports while using extraordinary measures (listing actions and transfers), and a final report after the measures are no longer in use (summarizing measures and administrative costs). The bill defines 'extraordinary measures', 'administrative cost', and 'debt limit'.",
