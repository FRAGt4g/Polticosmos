    "summary": "The Retirement Proxy Protection Act amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to clarify the fiduciary duties of those exercising shareholder rights related to plan assets. It specifies that fiduciaries must act prudently and solely in the interest of plan participants when voting proxies and exercising other shareholder rights. It outlines requirements for these activities, including considering costs, evaluating material facts, and maintaining records. The bill also allows for proxy voting policies, including safe harbor options, and mandates periodic reviews of these policies. The changes apply to exercises of shareholder rights on or after January 1, 2026.",
