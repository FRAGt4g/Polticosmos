    "summary": "The Poverty Line Act of 2025 proposes to update the methodology for calculating the Federal poverty line. It aims to incorporate more accurate costs of basic needs, reflect changing spending norms, account for regional variations, and consider the expenditures needed for social and economic mobility. The bill amends the Community Services Block Grant Act to revise how the poverty line is determined, including factors like food, housing, childcare, healthcare costs, and the cost of other basic goods. It also includes provisions for transition, evaluation, and reporting.",
