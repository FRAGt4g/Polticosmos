    "summary": "The 'Tailoring for Main Street\u2019s Investors Act' amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. It provides an exemption from registration for certain private fund advisers, based on their assets under management, the qualifications of their investors (qualified purchasers and accredited investors), and the absence of frequent redemption rights. The bill also modifies reporting requirements for smaller investment advisers, requiring them to file Form ADV less frequently and mandating the creation of a short-form version of Form ADV for these entities.",
