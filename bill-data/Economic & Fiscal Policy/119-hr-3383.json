    "summary": "The 'Increasing Investor Opportunities Act' amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to allow closed-end companies greater authority to invest in private funds. It restricts the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) ability to limit these investments or the listing of related securities. The bill also defines 'private fund' and adjusts certain investment limitations within the Act. It clarifies that the changes do not affect fiduciary duties, valuation, liquidity, or redemption requirements.",
