    "summary": "The Emergency Relief for Federal Workers Act of 2025 aims to provide financial relief to federal employees affected by government shutdowns. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to waive penalties for early Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) withdrawals due to furloughs or working without pay during a lapse in appropriations, up to $30,000. It also modifies TSP provisions regarding in-service withdrawals and loans to address missed payments during shutdowns, preventing them from being treated as taxable distributions.",
