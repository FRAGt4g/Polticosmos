    "summary": "The \"Stop Woke Investing Act\" directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to amend its rules regarding shareholder proposals. The bill would limit the number of shareholder proposals a company is required to include in its proxy statements, with the cap depending on the company's size. Crucially, it mandates that any included proposal must have a \"material effect on the financial performance\" of the company. The bill defines \"material\" to strictly mean a financial risk or return, explicitly excluding considerations for environmental, social, political, or other non-pecuniary goals, effectively targeting ESG-related shareholder activism.",
