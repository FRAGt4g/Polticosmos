    "summary": "The WOSB Accountability Act aims to modify how the government calculates goals for small business contracts. It primarily focuses on small businesses \"owned and controlled by women\" (WOSBs). The bill mandates that only WOSBs certified under Section 8(m)(2)(E) of the Small Business Act are included in these goals, excluding self-certified WOSBs. The bill also includes transition provisions for currently self-certified businesses and requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to issue regulations and provide quarterly briefings to congressional committees on the implementation progress, including application numbers, costs, and outreach efforts.",
