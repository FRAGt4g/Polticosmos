    "summary": "The \"Prevent Tariff Abuse Act\" (H.R. 407) amends the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to prohibit the President from using emergency authorities to impose tariffs or import quotas. This bill explicitly states that the powers granted to the President under IEEPA do not include the authority to levy duties or other quotas on goods entering the United States. The legislation aims to prevent the executive branch from unilaterally enacting trade restrictions under the guise of a national emergency, thereby reaffirming Congress's constitutional authority over trade policy.",
