    "summary": "The Small Entity Update Act mandates the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to study and revise the definition of \"small entity\" under securities laws. The SEC must conduct studies, submit reports to Congress with recommendations for amending the definition, and revise its rules accordingly. These revisions should consider market growth, alignment with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the goal of expanding the number of entities covered. The bill also requires inflation adjustments to any dollar figures in the definition.",
