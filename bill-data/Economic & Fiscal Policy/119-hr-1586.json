    "summary": "The WOSB Certification Expansion and Opportunity Act (H.R. 1586) aims to modify the Small Business Act regarding the certification of women-owned small businesses (WOSBs). The bill mandates that only certified WOSBs (under section 8(m)(2)(E)) are included in federal goals. It provides a temporary exception for self-certified WOSBs, requiring the Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator to issue regulations within a year and provide quarterly briefings to Congressional committees. The briefings cover application numbers, timelines, costs, outreach efforts, and recommendations. The bill defines key terms like 'Administration', 'Administrator', 'Small business concern' and provides a compliance note to prevent additional expenditures.",
