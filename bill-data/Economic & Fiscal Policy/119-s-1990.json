    "summary": "The Curtailing Unreasonable Remuneration at Banks Act, introduced in the Senate, aims to empower the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to regulate executive compensation at Federal Home Loan Banks. The bill amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to allow the Director to set reasonable and comparable compensation for executive officers, overriding certain restrictions from the 1992 Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act. This focuses on limiting excessive pay within the banking sector.",
