    "summary": "The Bank Failure Prevention Act of 2025 amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Home Owners' Loan Act to specify timelines and procedures for determining the completeness of acquisition applications related to depository institution holding companies. The bill mandates the Board to inform applicants about the completeness of their application records within 30 days (extendable to 60 days for complex applications).  It also sets a 90-day deadline for the Board to grant or deny applications, regardless of record completeness, with a deeming granted clause if the deadline is missed. Information from third parties cannot be used to determine completeness.",
