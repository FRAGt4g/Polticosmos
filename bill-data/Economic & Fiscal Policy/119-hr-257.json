    "summary": "Introduced in the House of Representatives, the \"Stop Environmental Calculations Act of 2025\" (H.R. 257) proposes an amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The bill aims to restrict the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by prohibiting it from requiring publicly traded companies to make climate-related disclosures. The only exception would be if such disclosures are proven to be \"material to investors,\" meaning the information is significant enough to influence an investor's decision. This legislation effectively limits the SEC's authority to mandate broad environmental reporting, tying it to a traditional financial materiality standard.",
