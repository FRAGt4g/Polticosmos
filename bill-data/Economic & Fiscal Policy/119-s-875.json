    "summary": "The Financial Integrity and Regulation Management Act (FIRM Act) aims to prevent federal banking agencies from considering \"reputational risk\" when supervising depository institutions. The bill defines reputational risk and mandates agencies remove it from guidance, examinations, and enforcement. It cites concerns that reputational risk allows agencies to implement political agendas and potentially discriminate against certain businesses. The bill requires federal banking agencies to submit reports to relevant congressional committees confirming implementation and detailing policy changes.",
