    "summary": "The American Ownership and Resilience Act (S. 1645) establishes a federal facility to provide leverage (loan guarantees) to \"ownership investment companies.\" These companies would invest in \"covered business concerns,\" with a focus on employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) and eligible worker-owned cooperatives. The bill defines various terms, sets capital requirements, outlines operational procedures (including independent trustees and fairness opinions for ESOP investments), and imposes employee allocation and share recirculation requirements. It also includes provisions for Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 OICs (companies with less experience) and sets a sunset date for the program.",
