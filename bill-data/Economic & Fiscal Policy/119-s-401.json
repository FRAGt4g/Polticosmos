    "summary": "The Fair Access to Banking Act aims to prevent financial service providers from denying services based on subjective criteria or political stances. It prohibits banks with over $10 billion in assets, payment card networks, and credit unions from refusing service to lawful businesses, especially those in politically sensitive industries. The bill amends existing laws to enforce these provisions, including prohibiting the use of taxpayer-funded discount window programs for non-compliant banks and establishing a civil penalty for payment card network violations. It also defines 'fair access to financial services' and allows for civil action against those who violate the law.",
