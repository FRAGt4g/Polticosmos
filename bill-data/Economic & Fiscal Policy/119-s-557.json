    "summary": "The bill, titled the \"1071 Repeal to Protect Small Business Lending Act,\" seeks to repeal Section 704B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. This section mandates data collection on small business loans by financial institutions. The bill argues that these requirements increase compliance costs, potentially hindering access to credit for small businesses, particularly smaller institutions. The bill aims to reduce regulatory burdens and support greater access to credit.",
