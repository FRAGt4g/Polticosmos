    "summary": "The Regulations Evaluated to Determine The Anticipated Price and Effect Act (RED TAPE Act) prohibits federal agencies from using non-monetized or unquantified factors in regulatory impact and benefit-cost analyses. It mandates agencies to prioritize quantifiable financial benefits and necessitates public transparency of these analyses, including methodologies. The bill also grants judicial review for affected parties and requires the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance. The main goal is to minimize regulatory costs by ensuring tangible financial benefits are prioritized.",
