    "summary": "The Axing Nonmarket Tariff Evasion Act (ANTE Act) aims to amend the Trade Act of 1974. It authorizes the U.S. Trade Representative to impose remedial measures on entities evading duties on goods from nonmarket economy countries. This involves investigating investments in third countries designed to avoid tariffs, and potentially imposing duties on goods produced by those entities. The bill defines \"covered entities\" and outlines the process for inquiries, determinations, and imposition of measures, including justification to Congress if measures aren't taken.",
