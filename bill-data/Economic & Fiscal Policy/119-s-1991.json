    "summary": "This bill, the Delivering On Government Efficiency in Spending Act (S. 1991), aims to improve the tracking and verification of federal fund payments. It mandates agencies to report payment information to the Treasury, with exceptions for sensitive operations. The bill also grants the Treasury access to data from the National Directory of New Hires, amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and allows for the sharing of tax and Social Security information to enhance the \"Do Not Pay\" system, aiming to prevent improper payments. It also focuses on bank account verification before payment and sets up a system to avoid payments to those with identity theft issues. The central goal is enhanced government accountability and efficiency in spending.",
