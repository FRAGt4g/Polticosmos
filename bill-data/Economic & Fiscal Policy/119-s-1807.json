    "summary": "The 'Timely and Accurate Benefits Act' mandates that states utilize an 'Enhanced Income Identification and Verification Platform' to receive federal funds for benefit programs. This platform, within one year of enactment, must include automated data matching, analysis, and the ability to access applicant-permissioned deposit account data to identify unreported income (including gig economy earnings, other income sources, and more). The goal is to improve accuracy and prevent improper payments in federal benefit programs.",
