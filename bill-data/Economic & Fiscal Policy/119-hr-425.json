    "summary": "Introduced by Representative Davidson and numerous cosponsors, H.R. 425, titled the \"Repealing Big Brother Overreach Act,\" proposes the complete repeal of the Corporate Transparency Act. This act, originally passed as part of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, requires many businesses to report their beneficial ownership information to the federal government to combat illicit financial activities. This bill would eliminate that requirement entirely by striking the law from the U.S. Code. It also makes the necessary technical amendments to other statutes to remove all references to the Corporate Transparency Act, reflecting a position against perceived government overreach and in favor of privacy.",
