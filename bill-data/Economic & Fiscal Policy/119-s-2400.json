The bill mandates updated Treasury guidance on high-value artwork transactions involving sanctioned individuals and requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue proposed rules to implement the amendments. It also includes technical and conforming amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020.",
