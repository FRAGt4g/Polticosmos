    "summary": "The Postal Contracting Financial Accountability Act amends U.S. Code to allow contractors to continue operating contract postal units even if the Postal Service intends to terminate or not renew the agreement.  Contractors can elect to keep the agreement in effect, though the Postal Service is not obligated to pay the contractor unless the Postmaster General deems it appropriate. The bill defines key terms like 'contract postal unit' and 'covered contractor'.",
