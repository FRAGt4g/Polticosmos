    "summary": "This bill, the Protecting Prudent Investment of Retirement Savings Act, amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). It focuses on specifying requirements for considering financial and non-financial factors when making investment decisions for retirement plans. Key provisions address limiting the use of non-pecuniary factors, requirements for exercising shareholder rights, and disclosure requirements for brokerage windows within retirement plans. The overall goal seems to be to ensure retirement savings are managed prudently and with full transparency for participants.",
