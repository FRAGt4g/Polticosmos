    "summary": "The Community Investment and Prosperity Act aims to allow the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to increase the amount of investments that national banking associations and State member banks can make to promote public welfare. The bill amends existing statutes (12 U.S.C. 24 and 338a) by increasing the percentage amount for these investments, effectively freeing up more capital for public welfare projects. The bill was introduced in the Senate on July 24, 2025.",
