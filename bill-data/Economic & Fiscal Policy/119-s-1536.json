    "summary": "The 'Building Ships in America Act of 2025' aims to bolster the U.S. maritime industry by providing tax incentives. It introduces a United States Vessel Investment Credit for constructing, repowering, or reconstructing qualified vessels in U.S. shipyards.  It also excludes certain maritime security payments from gross income, addresses tax parity for maritime fuel, and treats maritime prosperity zones as opportunity zones. Other provisions include incentives related to capital construction funds and shipyard construction, and modifications to existing tax code to support the industry.",
