    "summary": "The Student Loan Deduction Act of 2025 amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to allow households to deduct student loan payments from their income when calculating eligibility for food assistance programs. This applies to both federal and private student loans and begins 180 days after the bill's enactment. The bill aims to reduce the financial burden on individuals with student loan debt, thereby potentially increasing their eligibility for federal food assistance.",
