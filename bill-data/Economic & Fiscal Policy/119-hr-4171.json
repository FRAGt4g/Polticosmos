    "summary": "This bill, the Small Entrepreneurs\u2019 Empowerment and Development Act of 2025 (SEED Act), amends the Securities Act of 1933 to create a micro-offering exemption for small issuers.  It allows them to sell up to $250,000 in securities within a 12-month period without mandated disclosures, though subject to anti-fraud provisions.  The bill also mandates the SEC to establish disqualification provisions for those seeking to utilize this exemption, mirroring existing regulations, and makes conforming amendments to state regulations.  It aims to ease access to capital for small businesses.",
