    "summary": "The Regulation Decimation Act mandates that federal agencies repeal ten existing regulations before issuing a new one. For major rules, the cost of the new rule must be less than or equal to the cost of the repealed rules, certified by the Office of Management and Budget. The bill also requires agencies to review their existing rules within 90 days and submit a report to Congress. Finally, it mandates a presidential report on rule reduction within five years. The goal appears to be to reduce the regulatory burden on the public.",
