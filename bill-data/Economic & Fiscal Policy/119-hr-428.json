    "summary": "The Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act of 2025 encourages federal employees to report wasteful spending by enhancing cash award programs. It increases the maximum bonus for identifying cost-saving opportunities from $10,000 to $20,000. The bill formalizes a process where an agency's Chief Financial Officer validates \"wasteful expenses\" identified by an employee. If validated, these expenses are proposed for rescission. The act also introduces new requirements for agency reporting, oversight by the Office of Personnel Management, and periodic program reviews by the Comptroller General to ensure compliance and effectiveness.",
