    "summary": "The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act (S. 1124) aims to restrict the Federal Reserve's ability to issue or utilize a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The bill prohibits Federal Reserve Banks from offering products or services directly to individuals, maintaining individual accounts, or issuing a CBDC (or similar digital assets) directly or indirectly. It also prevents the Board of Governors from testing, developing, or using a CBDC for monetary policy, and expresses the sense of Congress that such authority doesn't exist unless granted by Congress.",
