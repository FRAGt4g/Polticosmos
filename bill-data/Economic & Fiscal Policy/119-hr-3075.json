    "summary": "This bill, the Locality-based Social Security Benefits Act of 2025, proposes to adjust Social Security benefits based on the cost of living in an individual's locality. It mandates the Commissioner of Social Security to increase monthly benefits to align with locality pay rates determined by the President under the authority provided in Title 5 of the U.S. Code and the Code of Federal Regulations, effectively tying benefits to local economic conditions and potentially increasing payments based on geographical location.",
