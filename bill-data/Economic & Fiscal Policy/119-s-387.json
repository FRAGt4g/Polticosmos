    "summary": "The Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act (S. 387) mandates that the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) ensure the small business regulatory budget for each small business concern is zero for fiscal year 2026 and beyond. This means businesses won't incur costs from SBA rulemakings. The bill also requires the Administrator to report annually to Congress on other federal agencies' rules impacting small businesses, disaggregated by agency. No additional funds are authorized for this act.",
