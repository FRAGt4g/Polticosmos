    "summary": "The Chief Risk Officer Enforcement and Accountability Act amends the Financial Stability Act of 2010. The bill mandates that large banking institutions appoint a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) responsible for establishing risk limits, overseeing risk management policies, and reporting deficiencies. The CRO must report to both the risk committee and CEO. Vacancies require notification to regulators and a plan for replacement. Banks with assets over $50 billion and without a holding company must also comply. The primary financial regulatory agencies will issue rules for the plan.",
