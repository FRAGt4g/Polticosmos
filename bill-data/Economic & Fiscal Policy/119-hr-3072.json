    "summary": "The DOGE Codification Act of 2025 aims to codify actions taken by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The bill retroactively authorizes all DOGE rules, policies, and actions, giving them the force of law. It further mandates that DOGE-led regulatory changes and cost-saving measures remain in effect unless altered by DOGE or Congress. This effectively solidifies DOGE's impact on government efficiency and budgetary practices.",
