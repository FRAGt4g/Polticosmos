The bill proposes to increase the resource limit for individuals to $20,000 in 2025 and for couples to $10,000 in the same year. It also includes provisions for adjusting these limits annually based on the Consumer Price Index to account for inflation, ensuring the limits maintain their purchasing power over time.",
