    "summary": "The End Government Shutdowns Act (H.R. 5542) aims to prevent government shutdowns by automatically providing continuing appropriations if a regular appropriations bill isn't enacted. It amends Title 31 of the United States Code to establish a new section specifying how funding for programs, projects, and activities should continue, albeit at a reduced rate, in the absence of a finalized budget or continuing resolution. The bill ensures that a percentage of the previous year\u2019s funding is available during the lapse until a new appropriations bill is passed.",
