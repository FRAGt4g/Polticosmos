    "summary": "The \"Investing in All of America Act of 2025\" amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. It primarily focuses on modifying leverage limits for Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs). The bill excludes certain investments in smaller enterprises in rural or low-income areas, small businesses in critical technology areas and small manufacturers from leverage calculations. The bill also adjusts dollar amounts related to leverage limits and introduces an annual adjustment tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), with exclusions for companies issuing accrual debentures.",
