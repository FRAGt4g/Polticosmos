    "summary": "The Crow Revenue Act aims to benefit the Crow Tribe of Montana by taking certain mineral interests into trust. It mandates the Secretary of the Interior to accept the relinquishment of the Bull Mountains Lease if offered. It requires the Hope Family Trust to convey mineral interests in the Hope Family Tracts to the Tribe, which can then be held in trust by the US. The Act also addresses revenue sharing, land withdrawal, and eligibility for federal benefits. This is primarily focused on benefiting the tribe and managing land and mineral rights.",
