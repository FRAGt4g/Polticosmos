    "summary": "H.R. 416, the \"No Welfare for the Wealthy Act of 2025,\" amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to tighten eligibility for food assistance benefits (like SNAP). The bill aims to close what it refers to as the \"nominal benefits loophole.\" It would require all households to meet the standard federal income and resource criteria to receive benefits. This change would end the practice where households could gain automatic eligibility for food aid through other programs without meeting these specific tests. The amendment would take effect one year after the bill's enactment.",
