    "summary": "The 'Forest Conservation Easement Program Act of 2025' amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to establish a Forest Conservation Easement Program. This program aims to conserve and restore eligible forest land and natural resources through the acquisition of easements. It defines key terms like 'eligible land,' 'forest land easement,' and 'eligible entity,' outlining various provisions for cost-share assistance, forest management plans, and technical assistance. The bill also repeals Title V of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 while providing transitional provisions for existing contracts. Funding of $100 million annually is authorized for the program.",
