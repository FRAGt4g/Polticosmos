    "summary": "The Quinault Indian Nation Land Transfer Act proposes to transfer approximately 72 acres of land in Washington State, currently managed by the Forest Service, to the Department of the Interior to be held in trust for the Quinault Indian Nation. The land will become part of the reservation but is explicitly prohibited from being used for gaming. The bill also ensures that the act does not affect existing treaty rights and outlines the Secretary of the Interior's responsibilities regarding hazardous materials on the land. ",
