    "summary": "The Farmland Security Act of 2025 amends the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978. It removes the limitation on civil penalties for violations, especially for foreign-owned shell corporations, which face penalties equal to 100% of the land's fair market value. The bill mandates annual audits of submitted reports, training for state and county personnel, and reports to Congress on foreign agricultural activities, including leasing, purchase trends by shell corporations, and foreign ownership of agricultural production. It also authorizes $2 million annually for 2025-2030 to implement the Act.",
