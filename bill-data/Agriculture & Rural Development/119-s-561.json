    "summary": "The Healthy SNAP Act of 2025 amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to redefine 'food' for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). It mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to designate, through regulations, which foods and food products are eligible, considering nutritional value, public health, and cultural eating patterns. The Secretary must review and update these designations at least every five years, ensuring consistency with scientific knowledge. State agencies can substitute designated foods with Secretary approval, provided the substitute is nutritionally equivalent, including prepared meals.",
