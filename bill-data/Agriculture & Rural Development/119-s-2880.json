    "summary": "The Great Lakes Mass Marking Program Act of 2025 establishes a program within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to mass mark hatchery-produced fish in the Great Lakes. The goal is to improve fishery management by tracking fish populations, evaluating hatchery effectiveness, and supporting collaborative efforts between federal, state, and tribal agencies. The bill authorizes $5 million annually from 2026-2030 to purchase equipment, hire personnel, and disseminate data aimed at understanding and improving Great Lakes fisheries, including efforts to enhance native species recovery and support recreational and commercial fishing.",
