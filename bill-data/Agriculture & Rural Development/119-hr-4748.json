    "summary": "The Agriculture Workforce Reform Act of 2025 aims to provide a pathway for certain aliens performing agricultural labor to obtain agricultural worker nonimmigrant status (H-2A). The bill addresses inadmissibility and removability grounds under the Immigration and Nationality Act. It mandates fees, grants immunity from prosecution for employers and covered aliens, and sets a 3-year admission period with potential renewal. Eligibility hinges on performing agricultural labor for at least two years and not unlawfully receiving public benefits. The covered period is limited to 3 years from the date of enactment.",
