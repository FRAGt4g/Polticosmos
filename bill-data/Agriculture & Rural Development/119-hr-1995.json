    "summary": "The Securing American Agriculture Act mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to annually assess U.S. dependency on critical agricultural products and inputs from China, focusing on potential vulnerabilities. The assessment will be submitted to relevant congressional committees and include recommendations to reduce dependency, mitigating supply chain threats, and reducing barriers to domestic production. The bill defines \"critical inputs\" broadly and outlines data collection, distribution, and confidentiality protocols for the gathered information, protecting trade secrets and preventing public disclosure of identifiable private entity information.",
