    "summary": "The Grasslands Grazing Act of 2025 aims to amend the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. This bill seeks to ensure that ranchers with grazing agreements on national grasslands are treated the same as permittees on other federal lands. Specifically, it amends Section 402(a) of the Act, substituting \u201clands within National Forests\u201d with \u201cNational Forest System\u201d land, as defined in related legislation. The bill addresses grazing rights on public lands, focusing on parity between different types of grazing permits.",
