    "summary": "The 'No Tariffs on Groceries Act' aims to restrict the President's ability to impose tariffs on food products. It mandates that any proposed tariffs on food must be submitted to Congress for approval via an Act of Congress. The Act defines 'articles of food' broadly and includes exceptions for existing tariff-rate quotas. This is intended to provide greater Congressional oversight of trade policy impacting the cost of food.",
