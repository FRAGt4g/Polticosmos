    "summary": "The 'Protecting America\u2019s Agricultural Land from Foreign Harm Act of 2025' aims to restrict the purchase or lease of U.S. agricultural land by entities associated with specific foreign governments (Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia). It defines \"covered persons,\" prohibits their land acquisition, and prevents their participation in Department of Agriculture programs. The bill amends the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978, expanding reporting requirements, increasing penalties, and enhancing transparency of foreign land ownership data. It mandates reports from the Secretary of Agriculture, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Government Accountability Office on related risks, intelligence, and enforcement. ",
