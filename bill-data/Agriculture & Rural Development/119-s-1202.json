    "summary": "The Hot Foods Act of 2025 aims to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to allow Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to be used for purchasing hot foods and hot food products. The bill modifies existing restrictions on SNAP benefits, enabling recipients to buy these items. It also addresses retailer eligibility, limiting hot food sales to no more than 50% of gross sales. The overall goal is to expand the types of food items eligible for SNAP benefits.",
