    "summary": "This bill, the \"Conservation and Regenerative Optimization Practices for Farming Act\" or \"CROP for Farming Act,\" amends the Food Security Act of 1985. It focuses on incentivizing farmers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (specifically nitrous oxide and methane) and increase carbon storage in plants and soil through conservation contracts. The bill aims to address these environmental concerns by modifying existing conservation program language to include these specific goals.",
