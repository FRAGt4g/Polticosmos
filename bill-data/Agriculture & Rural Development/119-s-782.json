    "summary": "The Expanding Local Meat Processing Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to amend regulations to allow certain small-scale meat packers to have an interest in market agencies. It exempts packers with specific daily and annual slaughter capacity limits for cattle/sheep and hogs. It mandates disclosure of packer relationships by market agencies and includes a savings clause to maintain the Secretary's existing authority to ensure producer protection, competition, market integrity, and the prevention of conflicts of interest under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.",
