    "summary": "The Emergency Conservation Program Improvement Act of 2025 amends the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978. It aims to remove barriers for agricultural producers accessing funds for emergency measures under the emergency conservation program, like repairing or replacing fencing and rehabilitating farmland. The bill also clarifies that wildfires caused by the federal government are covered. Additionally, it improves the emergency forest restoration program by allowing advance payments (up to 75%) to landowners for emergency measures on nonindustrial private forest land.",
