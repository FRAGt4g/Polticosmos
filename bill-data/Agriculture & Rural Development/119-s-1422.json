    "summary": "The Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act (S. 1422) amends the Internal Revenue Code to prioritize domestically produced feedstocks for clean fuel production credits, effectively excluding foreign feedstocks. It also adjusts the calculation of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions to exclude indirect land use changes, extends the clean fuel production credit's availability, and modifies the emissions factor rounding. The bill aims to support U.S. farmers and promote cleaner fuels.",
