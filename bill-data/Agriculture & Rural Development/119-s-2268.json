    "summary": "The Agricultural Risk Review Act of 2025 amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to include the Secretary of Agriculture on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). This aims to enhance oversight of foreign investments in U.S. agricultural land, biotechnology, and the agricultural industry. The bill mandates CFIUS to review reportable agricultural land transactions, particularly those involving entities from specific countries (China, North Korea, Russia, and Iran), if the Secretary of Agriculture has concerns. The requirements sunset when the listed countries are removed as foreign adversaries.",
