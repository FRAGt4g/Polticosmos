    "summary": "The Save Our Bacon Act seeks to ensure the free movement of livestock-derived products in interstate commerce. It aims to protect a national market for these products, prevent states from enacting restrictive laws on producers, and uphold international trade obligations. The bill defines \"covered livestock\" and clarifies what activities constitute \"production.\" The central provision grants producers a federal right to raise and market covered livestock in interstate commerce, limiting states' ability to impose additional production standards on products not physically raised within their borders.",
