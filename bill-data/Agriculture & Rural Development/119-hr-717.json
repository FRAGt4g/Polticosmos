    "summary": "The Wildlife Movement Through Partnerships Act of 2025 aims to promote wildlife connectivity by improving habitat quality in movement areas. It establishes the Wildlife Movement and Movement Area Grant Program, a State and Tribal Migration Research Program, and amends the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Act. The bill authorizes appropriations for these programs and for USGS wildlife corridor mapping, focusing on projects that benefit big game and facilitate collaboration among various stakeholders, including federal, state, and tribal agencies, non-profits, and landowners. The bill also includes provisions to protect private property rights and restricts the application of the funds to not require non-voluntary changes in certain permitted practices.",
