    "summary": "The Dairy Farm Resiliency Act amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to update the Dairy Margin Coverage program, a key federal risk management tool for dairy producers. The bill modifies how a farm's production history is calculated, basing it on the most recent three-year history instead of a fixed 2011-2013 baseline. It also increases the production quantity eligible for more favorable Tier I premium rates from 5 million to 6 million pounds. These changes are intended to help the program better reflect current farm production levels and enhance its support for dairy operations.",
