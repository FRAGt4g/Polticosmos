    "summary": "The Plant Biostimulant Act of 2025 amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to establish a consistent definition for plant biostimulants. It defines plant biostimulants, nutritional chemicals, and vitamin hormone products, and directs the EPA to revise regulations accordingly. The bill also mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a study assessing plant biostimulant use and practices that improve soil health, water quality, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. A report detailing the study's findings must be submitted to relevant congressional committees.",
