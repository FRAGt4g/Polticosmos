    "summary": "The Livestock Disaster Assistance Improvement Act of 2025 aims to improve disaster assistance programs within the Department of Agriculture. It covers several areas, including streamlining application processes for emergency conservation programs, expanding eligibility for such programs to include more land users and permanent infrastructure, and reforming the emergency forest restoration program. The bill also addresses the livestock forage disaster program and enhances emergency assistance for livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish. Furthermore, it mandates the creation of an interagency working group to improve data used in the United States Drought Monitor and promotes alignment of Farm Service Agency and Forest Service drought response.",
