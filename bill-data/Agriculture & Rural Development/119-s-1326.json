    "summary": "The Food Security and Farm Protection Act, introduced in the Senate, aims to prevent states and local jurisdictions from interfering with the production and distribution of agricultural products in interstate commerce.  It prohibits states from imposing additional standards on pre-harvest production in other states, beyond federal and the producing state's laws.  The bill also establishes a federal cause of action allowing challenges to state regulations impacting interstate agricultural commerce, including the ability to seek injunctive relief. The bill defines agricultural products by referencing the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946.",
