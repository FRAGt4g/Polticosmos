    "summary": "The Broadband Internet for Small Ports Act aims to improve broadband access in rural areas, particularly around ports. It amends the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to prioritize broadband loan and grant applications for projects providing service in rural ports and on agricultural land. The bill defines \"port,\" sets funding priorities, and mandates increased Secretary of Agriculture oversight. It also modifies grant percentages and application processes, requiring recipients to provide geolocation data and allowing for environmental review flexibility. Additionally, it ensures grant levels are comparable to high-cost support received from the Federal Communications Commission.",
