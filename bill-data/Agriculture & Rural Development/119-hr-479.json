    "summary": "The Healthy SNAP Act of 2025 amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to restrict the types of food available for purchase through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to designate eligible foods based on nutritional value, public health, and cultural eating patterns, while specifically excluding items like soft drinks, candy, and prepared desserts. This designated food list must be reviewed and updated at least every five years. The bill also allows states to substitute culturally appropriate foods if they are nutritionally equivalent, aiming to improve the health of SNAP recipients.",
