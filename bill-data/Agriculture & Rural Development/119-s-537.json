    "summary": "The 'Protecting Access for Hunters and Anglers Act of 2025' aims to prevent the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture from prohibiting the use of lead ammunition or tackle on federally controlled lands and waters open to hunting or fishing. Exceptions apply if a decline in wildlife populations is directly linked to lead use and state regulations are followed. The bill mandates Federal Register notification for any such prohibitions or regulations that might be put into effect.",
