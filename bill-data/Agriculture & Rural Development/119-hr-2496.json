    "summary": "The Dairy Nutrition Incentive Program Act of 2025 aims to improve the nutrition of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients by encouraging the purchase of naturally nutrient-rich dairy products. It mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a program providing incentives for dairy purchases, offering grants to eligible entities, and requiring independent evaluations of the program's effectiveness. The bill appropriates funds for the program and dictates transition from existing healthy fluid milk incentive projects. The Bill also outlines how the program should be run, including details on grant applications, project selection and evaluation. It mandates reports to Congress regarding the project\u2019s status and results of evaluations, and specifies funding amounts.",
