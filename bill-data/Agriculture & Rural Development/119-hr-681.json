    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 681, amends the Long-Term Leasing Act of August 9, 1955. It authorizes leases of up to 99 years for land held in trust for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah). The amendment specifically adds these tribes' reservations to the existing leasing authority, allowing for longer-term leases than previously permitted. This bill aims to improve the tribes' ability to manage and utilize their land, providing greater economic opportunity for them.",
