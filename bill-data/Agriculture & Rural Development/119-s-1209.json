    "summary": "The American Prairie Conservation Act amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act and the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. It mandates that producers who till native sod acreage for crop production must certify this acreage to the Secretary of Agriculture using acreage report forms and maps. The Secretary is required to submit annual reports to the Senate and House Agriculture Committees detailing certified acreage. This focuses on conservation efforts and reporting related to agricultural practices on native lands, impacting crop insurance and disaster assistance eligibility.",
