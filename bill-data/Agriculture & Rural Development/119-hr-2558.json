    "summary": "The Safeguarding American Food and Export Trade Yields Act of 2025 (SAFETY Act) aims to protect the use of common food and agricultural product names in foreign markets. It defines \"common name\" and provides examples (e.g., Asiago, Parmesan). The bill mandates coordination between the Secretary and the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate international agreements that defend American producers' right to use these names. Semi-annual briefings to relevant Congressional committees are required to report on these efforts.",
