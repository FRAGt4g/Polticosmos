    "summary": "The Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2025 aims to provide lasting protection for inventoried roadless areas within the National Forest System. The bill finds that these areas are valuable for ecological reasons (watersheds, biodiversity) and social reasons (recreation, Native American practices). It prohibits road construction, reconstruction, and logging in these areas where the Roadless Rule applies, ensuring the areas' continued protection within the context of multiple-use management, while allowing various uses and activities.",
