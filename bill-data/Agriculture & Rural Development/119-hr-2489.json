    "summary": "The Hunger-Free Future Act of 2025 aims to prevent the Secretary of Agriculture from updating the thrifty food plan in a way that increases food insecurity. The bill amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to ensure that any reevaluation or update does not lead to more households lacking adequate food due to insufficient resources. The act is introduced by Ms. Brown and others, and referred to the Committee on Agriculture.",
