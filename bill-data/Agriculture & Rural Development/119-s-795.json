    "summary": "The Farmers Freedom Act of 2025 seeks to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. It aims to exclude \"prior converted cropland\" from the definition of \"navigable waters.\" The bill defines prior converted cropland and outlines exclusions for abandoned areas that have reverted to wetlands. It also prohibits the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers from applying the 'change in use' policy from the 2023 Revised Definition of Waters of the United States. The bill is intended to provide regulatory relief for farmers.",
