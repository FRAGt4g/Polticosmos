    "summary": "The Ski Hill Resources for Economic Development Act (H.R. 1084) amends the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996. It establishes a Ski Area Fee Retention Account within the Treasury, funded by ski area permit rental charges collected by the Secretary of Agriculture. These funds (80%) are primarily distributed to the covered unit for activities like program administration, staff training, visitor services, and safety measures. Some funding (20%) is agency-wide. The Act aims to improve ski area program administration and infrastructure within the National Forest System while ensuring funds supplement, not supplant, appropriated funding.",
