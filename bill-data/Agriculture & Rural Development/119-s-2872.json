    "summary": "The Emergency Pine Beetle Response Act of 2025 aims to address pine beetle outbreaks. It amends the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 to provide financial assistance. This includes direct payments to owners of nonindustrial private forest land (up to 85% of costs) and timber service businesses (up to 50% of eligible costs) for outbreak response measures. The bill also authorizes emergency loans to nonindustrial private forest land owners and offers supplemental grants to state, tribal, and local governments for outbreak response.",
