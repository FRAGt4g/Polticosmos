    "summary": "The Fire Safe Electrical Corridors Act of 2025 authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to allow electrical utilities to remove trees and vegetation near power lines on federal lands (National Forest System and Bureau of Land Management lands) without requiring a timber sale. This permission is contingent on adherence to land management plans and environmental laws. The bill also outlines that if the utility sells the removed material, proceeds (minus transportation costs) must be given to the Secretary.  The bill aims to improve fire safety and is titled \"Fire Safe Electrical Corridors Act of 2025.\"",
