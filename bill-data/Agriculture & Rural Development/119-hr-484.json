    "summary": "The Food Deserts Act aims to combat food insecurity by authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to provide grants to states for establishing revolving funds. These funds will support the creation and operation of grocery stores in underserved communities. Loans from the funds can be used for various purposes, including opening new stores, supporting existing ones, promoting access to healthy food, and supporting related programs. The bill outlines eligibility criteria, loan conditions, and technical assistance provisions, culminating in an authorization of $150 million for fiscal year 2026.",
