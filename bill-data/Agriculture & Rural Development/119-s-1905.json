    "summary": "The SNAP Administrator Retention Act of 2025 amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to improve staffing and retention within the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). It mandates wage standards for state agency personnel administering SNAP, tying wages to federal employee pay rates and requiring annual updates. The bill also increases the federal cost share for administrative personnel costs to 100% upon approval of state wage plans, aiming to supplement existing funding, not supplant it, and incentivizing more full-time equivalent positions within the program.",
