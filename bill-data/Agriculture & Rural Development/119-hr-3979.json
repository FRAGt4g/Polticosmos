    "summary": "The Leveraging Efficiency Awareness for Pumping Systems Act (LEAPS Act) aims to promote energy efficiency in agricultural pumping systems. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop educational resources for farmers on the benefits of energy-efficient systems, including cost savings, energy savings, water conservation, and carbon emission reductions. The bill also mandates the creation of a pre-assessment tool for farmers and calls for education on energy efficiency for Department of Agriculture auditors. Furthermore, the bill amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to include energy-efficient pumping systems in conservation stewardship program activities.",
