    "summary": "The \"Small Cemetery Conveyance Act\" amends the Small Tract Act of 1983 to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to convey, without consideration, certain cemeteries to qualified entities (state/local governments, Indian Tribes, or qualified land grant-merceds). It defines 'cemetery' and 'qualified person,' outlines conditions for conveyance, including reversion if the land isn't used as a cemetery, and allows for waivers of conveyance costs. The bill also clarifies that the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act is unaffected.",
