    "summary": "The Healthy Foods for Native Seniors Act, introduced in the House of Representatives, proposes a demonstration project allowing Tribal entities to purchase agricultural commodities for the commodity supplemental food program (CSFP). The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a project enabling Tribal entities to enter self-determination contracts to buy agricultural goods. The bill outlines eligibility criteria, specifies procurement guidelines for commodities (domestically produced, of similar or higher nutritional value, etc.), and mandates annual reports to relevant congressional committees. It also authorizes appropriations for the project and administrative costs.",
