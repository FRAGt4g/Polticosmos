    "summary": "The 'Livestock Owned by Communities to Advance Local Foods Act of 2025' amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act. It exempts certain livestock owners from inspection requirements if the slaughtering, preparation, and transportation of meat products are solely for the owner's use, household, nonpaying guests, or employees. It ensures that owners maintain custody and specific identification if an agent assists in these processes.",
