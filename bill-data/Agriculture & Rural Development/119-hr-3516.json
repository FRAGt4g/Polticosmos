    "summary": "The Opportunities for Fairness in Farming Act of 2025 aims to increase transparency and prevent misuse of funds in agricultural checkoff programs. The bill prohibits checkoff boards from contracting with entities that lobby or have conflicts of interest, and mandates public disclosure of budgets, disbursements, and contracts. It also requires audits by the Inspector General and Comptroller General to ensure compliance and assess the programs' integrity. The act defines key terms like 'Board' and 'checkoff program' and specifies which programs are covered under its guidelines. The bill also includes a severability clause.",
