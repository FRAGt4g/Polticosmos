    "summary": "The Cold-blooded Animal Research and Exhibition Act (H.R. 2976) amends the Animal Welfare Act. The bill's primary goal is to include cold-blooded animals, such as reptiles, amphibians, cephalopods, and fish, under the definition of 'animal' within the Act. This would subject these species to regulations concerning research, testing, experimentation, and exhibition, while excluding animals bred for food or fiber.",
