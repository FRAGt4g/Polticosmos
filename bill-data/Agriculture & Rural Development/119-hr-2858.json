    "summary": "The Winter Canola Study Act of 2025 aims to promote the growth of winter canola. It mandates research on including covered oilseed crops (rapeseed and canola) in double and rotational cropping policies, examining the impact on crop insurance. The bill also amends the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, directing the National Institute of Food and Agriculture to research supplemental crops like winter canola and allocating $10 million annually from 2024 to 2029 for this. Finally, it requires a report to Congress on the research findings and any recommendations.",
