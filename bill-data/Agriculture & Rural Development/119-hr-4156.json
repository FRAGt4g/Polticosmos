    "summary": "The SOIL Act (H.R. 4156) proposes a pilot program to streamline the application process for direct farm ownership loans. The bill amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to allow the Secretary to establish pre-approval or pre-qualification for these loans. This aims to provide greater certainty to borrowers. The Secretary is required to report on the program's progress to relevant congressional committees. The authority granted by this section is set to expire on September 30, 2030.",
