    "summary": "The \"Fill the Lake Act\" directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage the water level of Flathead Lake in Montana. From June 15th to September 15th each year, the Secretary must maintain a lake level between 2892 feet (minimum) and 2893 feet (maximum) above mean sea level. This involves using water from Hungry Horse Reservoir to maintain the minimum level and releasing excess water downstream to avoid exceeding the maximum level.",
