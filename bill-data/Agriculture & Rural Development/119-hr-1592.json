    "summary": "This bill, the Securing Our Lands and Resources Act (SOLAR Act), aims to limit USDA funding for ground-mounted solar energy systems that convert covered farmland. It defines covered farmland, conversion, and the Secretary of Agriculture. The bill prohibits financial assistance for projects causing farmland conversion, with exceptions for small projects, those with primarily on-farm use, or those with local government approval.  It mandates farmland conservation plans for approved projects, requires soil health remediation, and outlines compliance and repayment obligations.",
