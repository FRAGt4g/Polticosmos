    "summary": "The 'Strategic Grazing to Reduce Risk of Wildfire Act' (S. 1981) mandates the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to develop a strategy for utilizing livestock grazing to mitigate wildfire risk. This strategy, developed in coordination with permit holders and consultation with stakeholders, will consider targeted grazing, use of temporary permits, integration of technology, workforce development, and cooperative agreements with external entities. The bill focuses on areas like the wildland urban interface and post-fire recovery efforts, while also respecting existing grazing programs.",
