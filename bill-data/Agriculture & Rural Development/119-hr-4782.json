    "summary": "The 'Local Farmers Feeding our Communities Act' proposes a program where the Secretary of Agriculture will enter into cooperative agreements with state, local, or tribal governments. The agreements aim to increase the purchase of local foods from farmers, including small and mid-sized producers, and distribute them to organizations for distribution, enhancing food security. The bill defines key terms like 'covered producer' and allocates funding from the Commodity Credit Corporation and authorized appropriations for the program's operations from fiscal year 2026 onwards.",
