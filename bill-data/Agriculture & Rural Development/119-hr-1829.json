    "summary": "This bill, the Apache County and Navajo County Conveyance Act of 2025, mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer specific parcels of land within the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona to Navajo County and Apache County.  The land will be used for cemeteries. The conveyances are without financial cost, via quitclaim deeds, subject to existing rights, and require the counties to cover associated costs.  If the lands are not used as cemeteries, they revert back to the U.S. government.",
