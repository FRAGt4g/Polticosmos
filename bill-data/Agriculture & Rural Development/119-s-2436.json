    "summary": "The Healthy Drinking Water Affordability Act (S. 2436) amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to establish a grant program aimed at improving drinking water quality in rural areas. The program provides financial assistance to eligible grant recipients, including homeowners, renters, and non-profit organizations, to purchase, install, and maintain point-of-entry and point-of-use drinking water quality improvement products. These products are designed to address the presence of contaminants like lead, arsenic, and PFAS in the water supply. The Secretary of Agriculture will oversee the program, allocating funds to address water quality challenges and provide reports to Congress on the program's effectiveness and emerging needs.",
