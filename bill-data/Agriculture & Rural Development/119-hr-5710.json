    "summary": "The 'Bridge the Gap for Rural Communities Act' aims to aid farmers. It suspends payment limitations for agricultural risk coverage and price loss coverage for the 2025 crop year. It also mandates advance partial payments to producers by December 31, 2025, allowing them to receive 50% of their projected payments. Subsequent payments are to be made after the marketing year ends, with provisions for repayment if overpaid. The bill clarifies the assignment of these payments.",
