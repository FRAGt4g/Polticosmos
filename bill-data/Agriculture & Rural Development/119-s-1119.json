    "summary": "The 'Fortifying Refrigeration Infrastructure and Developing Global Exports Act of 2025' (FRIDGE Act) addresses deficiencies in cold chain infrastructure in foreign markets that hinder U.S. agricultural exports. The bill amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to provide technical assistance, through contracts with eligible trade organizations, for needs assessments, training, infrastructure improvements (cold chain, ports, etc.).  It authorizes $1 million in appropriations annually from 2026-2030 to support these efforts and aims to reduce food loss and promote trade.",
