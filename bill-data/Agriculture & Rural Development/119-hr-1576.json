    "summary": "This bill, the 'Protecting American Agriculture from Foreign Adversaries Act of 2025,' amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to address foreign investment in U.S. agriculture. It mandates the Secretary of Agriculture's inclusion on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States when reviewing transactions involving agricultural land, biotechnology, and the agriculture industry. The bill also requires the Committee to review reportable agricultural land transactions, particularly those involving foreign persons from specific adversarial nations. These requirements expire if those nations are removed from the foreign adversaries list.",
