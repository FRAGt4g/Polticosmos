    "summary": "The Farmland Security Act of 2025 amends the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978. It removes the limitation on civil penalties for violations of the Act, especially targeting foreign-owned shell corporations. The bill sets the penalty for shell corporations at 100% of the land's fair market value. It also mandates annual audits of submitted reports, provides training for state and county personnel, and requires the Secretary to submit reports to Congress on foreign agricultural activities, including leasing, shell corporation land purchases, and agricultural production capacity. Finally, it authorizes $2 million annually from 2025-2030 to carry out the Act.",
