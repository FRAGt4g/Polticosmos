    "summary": "This bill, the USDA Communication Regarding Oversight of Pesticides Act of 2025, aims to improve coordination between the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) regarding pesticide regulation. It mandates the EPA to coordinate with the Secretary of Agriculture on risk mitigation measures, data sharing (including agronomic use data and information on alternatives), and actions related to endangered species. The bill also allows for waivers of these coordination requirements under certain conditions, and requires transparency in the use of USDA data in EPA decisions.",
