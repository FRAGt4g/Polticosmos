    "summary": "The SNAP Staffing Flexibility Act of 2025 (H.R. 2811) amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to allow state agencies to contract with external contractors to process Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) applications under specific conditions. This flexibility aims to address surges in applications due to events like pandemics or natural disasters, but the contracts must adhere to certain guidelines, including not incentivizing eligibility denials and the contractor having no financial interest in retail stores. The act requires notifications to the Secretary, public disclosures, and annual reports to relevant committees. Notably, it emphasizes a 'blended workforce' approach and doesn't allow contractors to supplant existing state employees. ",
