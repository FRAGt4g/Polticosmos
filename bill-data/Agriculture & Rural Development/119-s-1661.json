    "summary": "The Disaster Relief for Farmworkers Act of 2025 amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to provide emergency assistance to farmworkers impacted by covered disasters. This includes adverse weather events, health crises (like pandemics), and other events causing income loss or work disruption. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Under Secretary for Rural Development, will make grants to eligible farmworker organizations to provide relief, build capacity, and address future losses. Funds remain available until expended, and the Secretary must consult with farmworker organizations and develop a promotional plan.",
