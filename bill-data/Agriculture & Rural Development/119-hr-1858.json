    "summary": "The Flooding Prevention, Assessment, and Restoration Act amends the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 to enhance the emergency watershed program, allowing for measures beyond immediate impairment if long-term health and cost-effectiveness are ensured. It also mandates a national agriculture flood vulnerability study within two years, assessing economic losses, downstream effects, and existing data on flood risk. Furthermore, it modifies the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act to address the rehabilitation of structural measures, adjusting cost-sharing percentages.",
