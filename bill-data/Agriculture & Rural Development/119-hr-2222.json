    "summary": "The 'Lowering Egg Prices Act of 2025' aims to reduce egg prices by exempting surplus broiler hatching eggs sold to egg breakers from certain regulations. The bill modifies existing regulations (specifically, section 118.4(e) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations) related to shell eggs. It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue a revised rule within 180 days, allowing for temperature and storage conditions suitable for hatching chicks and sales to egg breakers. The bill defines key terms like 'egg breaker' and 'broiler hatching egg'.",
