It mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to recognize centers of excellence for agricultural research, extension, and education across various focus areas like aquaculture, biosecurity, and digital agriculture. The bill outlines eligible host institutions, the duration of awards, and reporting requirements. It also modifies the agriculture and food protection grant program to support research against threats to the U.S. food system, with authorized appropriations for both programs.",
