    "summary": "The SNAP Administrator Retention Act of 2025 aims to improve staffing and retention in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The bill amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 by increasing the federal cost share for state agency administrative personnel costs to 100 percent, provided the state adheres to wage standards for personnel, including pay parity with federal employees and locality adjustments. State agencies must submit wage plans, and funding must supplement, not supplant, existing funds or expand full-time equivalent positions.",
