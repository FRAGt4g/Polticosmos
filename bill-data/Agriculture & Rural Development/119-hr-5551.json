    "summary": "The Balanced Agricultural Support and Efficiency Act aims to update base acres for covered commodities under the Agricultural Act of 2014. It mandates a one-time update of base acres to reflect planting history from 2020-2024. The update formula considers the 5-year average of planted acreage for each covered commodity, including prevented planting acreage due to various disasters. The bill also makes conforming amendments to payment yields, payment acres, and price loss coverage, removing references to generic base acres. The core goal is to adjust agricultural support based on recent farming practices.",
