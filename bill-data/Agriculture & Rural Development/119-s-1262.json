    "summary": "This bill concerns land in the Black River State Forest in Millston, Wisconsin. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to release a reversionary interest the United States holds in specific state forest land. The release is contingent upon Wisconsin conveying the State forest land to Deli, Inc., with Deli, Inc., subsequently conveying other land (Deli land) to the state. This exchange aims to consolidate land ownership within the Black River State Forest. A quitclaim deed from the Secretary of Agriculture will finalize the release, with the ability to correct land descriptions in consultation with the state.",
