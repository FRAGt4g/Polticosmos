    "summary": "The North Dakota Trust Lands Completion Act of 2025 addresses the exchange of land and mineral rights between the State of North Dakota and the federal government, primarily focusing on lands within or near Indian reservations. It allows the state to relinquish certain land grant parcels in exchange for unappropriated federal land of equivalent value. The bill outlines the processes for selection, valuation via appraisal, conveyance, and management of the exchanged lands, including provisions for tribal consultation and land being taken into trust. It also addresses issues like grazing permits, hazardous materials, and existing rights of land use.",
