    "summary": "The Keep Finfish Free Act of 2025 aims to prohibit federal agencies from authorizing or facilitating commercial finfish aquaculture operations within the United States' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The bill defines 'finfish' and 'commercial finfish aquaculture', and mandates that such operations require a specific Federal statute enacted after the bill's passage. This ensures Congressional approval before any finfish farming can occur in the specified marine areas.",
