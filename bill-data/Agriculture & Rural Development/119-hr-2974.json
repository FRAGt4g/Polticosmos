    "summary": "The bill, titled the \"Training and Nutrition Stability Act,\" aims to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008. It focuses on exempting workforce training dollars from being counted as income for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) beneficiaries. Specifically, it seeks to modify section 5 of the Act and exclude income from various employment and training programs, vocational rehabilitation, and refugee employment programs when determining SNAP eligibility. The bill seeks to support low-income families by making them eligible to get SNAP benefits while participating in workforce development training programs. This is intended to ensure that participating in these programs won't jeopardize their SNAP benefits. ",
