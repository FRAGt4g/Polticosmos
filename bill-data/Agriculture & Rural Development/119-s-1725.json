    "summary": "The Healthy Dog Importation Act amends the Animal Health Protection Act to regulate the importation of live dogs into the United States.  It mandates requirements for health documentation (vaccinations, parasite treatment, health certificates) and identification, particularly for dogs intended for transfer (sale, adoption). Exceptions are made for personal pets, military working dogs, research, veterinary treatment, and dogs under 6 months from specific locations entering Hawaii.  The bill tasks the Secretary with creating regulations to facilitate documentation submission, implement verification processes and establishes enforcement  and a transition period.",
