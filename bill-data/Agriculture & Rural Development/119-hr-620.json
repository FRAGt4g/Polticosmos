    "summary": "The Foreign Adversary Risk Management Act (FARM Act) aims to protect the U.S. agriculture industry from foreign influence. It amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to include agriculture in the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews, particularly focusing on transactions that could lead to foreign control of U.S. agricultural businesses. The bill also includes agricultural supply chains as critical infrastructure and critical technologies. Furthermore, it mandates annual reports from the Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General on foreign investments in the agriculture sector, potential threats, and related espionage.",
