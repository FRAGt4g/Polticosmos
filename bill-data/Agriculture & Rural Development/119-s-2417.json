    "summary": "The Star-Spangled Summit Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a 10-year special use permit for maintaining a covered flagpole (bearing the U.S. flag) at Kyhv Peak Lookout Point in Utah. The permit is initially offered to Robert S. Collins of Provo, Utah; otherwise, it is awarded to a qualified person (Utah County resident, non-profit, or volunteer organization) with relevant experience. The bill outlines application processes, prioritization criteria (including giving priority to former permit holders), and permit terms. It exempts land use fees, mandates public notice, and addresses permit renewal or early termination. Importantly, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) does not apply. The Secretary is required to authorize access for exercising rights under the permit, subject to conditions for public safety and natural resources.",
