    "summary": "The Rural Veterinary Workforce Act (H.R. 2398) aims to address the shortage of veterinary services in rural areas. It amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude certain veterinary student loan repayment or forgiveness programs from taxable income, thereby incentivizing veterinarians to work in underserved locations. The bill references existing federal and state programs under the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977. The amendments would apply to amounts received in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.",
