It increases duties based on both a percentage and a per-kilogram rate for various HTS subheadings. The bill also mandates the President to impose an additional duty of $0.10 per kilogram on imported shrimp, using the revenue for shrimp and catfish inspections. It addresses country of origin labeling for cooked shrimp and crawfish and directs modification of regulations related to processed food labeling and requires the US Trade Representative to modify the Schedule of Concessions to GATT 1994.",
