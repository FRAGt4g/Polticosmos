    "summary": "The \"Linking Access to Spur Technology for Agriculture Connectivity in Rural Environments Act of 2025\" (LAST ACRE Act) aims to improve broadband internet access for agricultural producers. It amends the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to establish a \"Last Acre Program\" offering grants and loans to providers to expand high-speed internet to unserved and underserved agricultural land. The bill defines key terms, sets application procedures, prioritizes project funding, addresses cybersecurity, and requires reporting to Congress and data sharing with the FCC. It also repeals existing sections of the Rural Electrification Act and mandates the collection of more comprehensive broadband usage data by the National Agricultural Statistics Service.",
