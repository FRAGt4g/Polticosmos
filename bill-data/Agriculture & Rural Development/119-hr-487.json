    "summary": "The Hawaii Invasive Species Protection Act (H.R. 487) mandates preclearance quarantine inspections for all items and people traveling to or from Hawaii to prevent the introduction of high-risk invasive species and agricultural materials. These inspections, conducted by various federal agencies in cooperation with the state of Hawaii, will include visual, x-ray, and canine screenings at departure airports, ports, and postal facilities. The bill amends existing laws regarding agricultural inspections and collection of fees to support these enhanced inspections, including for plant exports and transits.",
