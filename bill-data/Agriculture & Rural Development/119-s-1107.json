    "summary": "The Making Access To Cleanup Happen Act of 2025 (MATCH Act) amends the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978. It focuses on emergency watershed protection measures. The bill allows sponsors (State/local governments and Indian Tribes) to incur pre-agreement costs for these measures, with the Secretary of Agriculture developing a list and procedure for cost consideration.  If an agreement is made, such costs contribute to the sponsor's project contribution. It also clarifies that sponsors assume the risk of pre-agreement costs. The bill aims to facilitate quicker responses to natural disasters.",
