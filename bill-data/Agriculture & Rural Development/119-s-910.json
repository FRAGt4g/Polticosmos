    "summary": "The Farm Ownership Improvement Act (S. 910) mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to create a 5-year pilot program to pre-qualify or pre-approve farmers and ranchers for direct farm ownership loans. The bill amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, outlining borrower viability assessments, outreach priorities for beginning farmers, and evaluation/reporting requirements to Congress. The program aims to streamline loan processes and assess financial viability, potentially leading to a permanent program.",
