    "summary": "The Increased TSP Access Act of 2025 amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to modify the delivery of technical assistance for conservation practices. Key changes include defining \"non-Federal certifying entity,\" streamlining the certification process for third-party providers (including agricultural retailers and other organizations), and establishing payment amounts for their services. The bill mandates a review of certification requirements, sets a target utilization rate for third-party providers, and requires increased public transparency regarding funds, certification results, and provider contributions.",
