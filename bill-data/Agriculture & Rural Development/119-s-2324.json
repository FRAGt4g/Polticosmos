    "summary": "The Pesticide Injury Accountability Act of 2025 amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.  It establishes a private right of action, allowing individuals injured by pesticides to sue pesticide registrants in federal court for monetary damages.  Damages can include compensatory and punitive damages, but exclude attorney's fees and court costs.  The bill also clarifies that the new federal right of action does not preempt any state law claims.",
