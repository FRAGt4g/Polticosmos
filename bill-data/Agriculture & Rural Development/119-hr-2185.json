    "summary": "The 'Mink: Vectors for Infection Risk in the United States Act' (Mink VIRUS Act) aims to protect public health by prohibiting mink farming in the US. It mandates humane euthanasia methods for mink and sets penalties for non-compliance. The bill establishes a payment program to compensate fur farm owners for costs and losses associated with ceasing operations. It also defines key terms related to fur, fur-bearing animals, and mink, as well as the scope of the legislation and related financial considerations.",
