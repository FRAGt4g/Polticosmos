    "summary": "The bill, titled the Small and Homestead Independent Producers Act of 2025, allows small cannabis cultivators and manufacturers in states where it's legal to ship cannabis and cannabis products via mail and commercial carriers. It mandates age verification (21+) for recipients. It preempts state laws restricting cannabis shipment, but doesn't override states where cannabis is illegal. The Postal Service is directed to allow mailing of cannabis under its regulations. It also defines key terms such as 'small cultivator,' 'small manufacturer,' and different cultivation methods. The bill's effective date is tied to federal cannabis rescheduling and elimination of associated criminal penalties.",
