    "summary": "The 'Resiliency for Ranching and Natural Conservation Health Act' amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. It allows holders of grazing permits/leases to temporarily use vacant grazing allotments when their original allotments become unusable due to natural disasters (like drought or wildfire). The bill outlines the terms, conditions, and duration of this temporary use, mandates the Secretary to establish guidelines, and requires periodic evaluations of land health. The goal is to aid ranchers during extreme events.",
