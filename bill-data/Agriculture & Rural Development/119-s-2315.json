    "summary": "The Habitat Enhancement Now Act is a bill introduced in the U.S. Senate to establish grant programs aimed at sustaining migratory waterfowl populations. It focuses on habitat conservation through two main initiatives: a hen house grant program to improve nesting success in the prairie pothole region, and a breeding habitat grant program within California. Both programs award funds to eligible entities for habitat development. The bill allocates $3.5 million annually from 2026-2030 for each program.",
