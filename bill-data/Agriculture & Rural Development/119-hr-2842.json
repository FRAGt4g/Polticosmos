    "summary": "The 'Stop Raising Prices on Food Act' limits the President's authority to impose new or increased duties on agricultural imports from major trading partners. The bill defines \u201ccovered country\u201d as one of the top 5 countries importing U.S. agricultural goods, and details the process the President must follow, including congressional approval via a joint resolution, before implementing new tariffs. This aims to protect U.S. agricultural interests and requires justification to Congress before tariffs are applied.",
