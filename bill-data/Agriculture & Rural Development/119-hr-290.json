    "summary": "The Rural Telehealth and Education Enhancement Act of 2025 (H.R. 290) is a bipartisan bill that seeks to reauthorize the Department of Agriculture's Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program. It proposes amending the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to extend the program's operation from its 2023 expiration to 2030. This ensures continued support for projects that use telecommunications to provide improved access to healthcare and education for people living in rural communities, bridging critical service gaps.",
