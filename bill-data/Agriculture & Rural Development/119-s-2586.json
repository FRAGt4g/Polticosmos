    "summary": "The Marine Aquaculture Research for America Act of 2025 aims to promote and regulate commercial-scale offshore aquaculture in the United States. It charges the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with establishing an assessment program to study the viability of offshore aquaculture through demonstration projects. The bill also establishes Aquaculture Centers of Excellence for workforce development, provides support for working waterfronts, and commissions studies on environmental impact and regulatory frameworks. The goal is to expand domestic seafood production, reduce the seafood trade deficit, and support the seafood industry.",
