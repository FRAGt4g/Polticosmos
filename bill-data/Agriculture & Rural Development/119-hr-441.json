    "summary": "The Drought Assistance Improvement Act amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to expand federal aid for farmers. It revises the Livestock Forage Disaster Program, allowing producers to receive partial payment for shorter drought periods (4+ weeks) and increasing payments for longer droughts (8+ weeks). The bill also broadens the Emergency Assistance Program for livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish to explicitly cover drought as a qualifying event. Specifically, it directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish documentation standards for drought-related crawfish losses and makes those losses eligible for assistance.",
