    "summary": "The WaterSMART Access for Tribes Act aims to amend the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 to improve Tribal access to water conservation and efficiency grants. The bill focuses on allowing the Secretary to reduce or waive the non-Federal share of costs for infrastructure improvements or activities related to water management grants, if the Secretary determines contributing the non-Federal share would create financial hardship for the Indian Tribe. This act ultimately seeks to facilitate greater Tribal participation in water management projects.",
