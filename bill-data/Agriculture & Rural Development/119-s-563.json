    "summary": "This bill, the Ohkay Owingeh Rio Chama Water Rights Settlement Act of 2025, aims to resolve water rights claims of the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo in New Mexico's Rio Chama Stream System. It ratifies an existing agreement, authorizes funding, and defines terms related to water rights. The Act establishes a trust fund for the Pueblo, outlining permitted uses, including infrastructure, environmental compliance, and water rights management. It specifies waivers of claims, the roles of various parties (including the Secretary of the Interior), and the conditions for enforceability, including state and federal compliance. The bill also details the state's responsibilities, and the Act will expire if certain actions are not met by a specific date. The bill is intended to provide funds for infrastructure and restoration in the area as well.",
