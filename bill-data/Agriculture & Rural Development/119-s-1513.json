    "summary": "This bill, the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe Project Lands Restoration Act, aims to take approximately 1,082.63 acres of federal land in Washington into trust for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. The land, part of the Olympic National Park, will become part of the Tribe's reservation. The bill specifies land management guidelines, including those related to the Elwha River, and mandates a survey to define boundaries.  It also prevents the land from being considered Indian lands for gaming purposes and affirms that the bill does not affect treaty rights.",
