    "summary": "This bill, the \"Rural Broadband Window of Opportunity Act,\" directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to change its application processing for the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase II auction. The FCC must prioritize the timely review of long-form applications from service providers proposing to build broadband infrastructure in geographic areas with the shortest construction seasons, such as those with long winters and heavy snowfall. The stated purpose is to level the playing field for these providers, allowing them to begin construction projects more promptly and expand rural broadband access.",
