    "summary": "The Assistance for Rural Water Systems Act of 2025 aims to provide additional financial assistance to rural water, wastewater, and waste disposal systems. It amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, allowing the Secretary to provide grants and loans (with potentially low or no interest), forgive existing loan principal/interest, or refinance existing loans. Assistance is targeted towards entities needing resources for public health/safety or facing financial hardship, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with guidelines for determining eligibility based on affordability and economic distress.",
