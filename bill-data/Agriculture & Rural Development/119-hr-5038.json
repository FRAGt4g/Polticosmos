    "summary": "The American Protein Processing Modernization Act directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and publish food safety criteria for reviewing requests from meat and poultry establishments seeking to operate at alternate inspection rates. The bill mandates a response time of 90 days for request approvals or denials, with automatic approval if the deadline isn't met. It also addresses the continuation of operations for existing establishments, outlines procedures for noncompliance, and defines key terms related to alternate inspection rates. The bill emphasizes that the Department of Agriculture and the Food Safety and Inspection Service are not responsible for worker safety or environmental impacts.",
