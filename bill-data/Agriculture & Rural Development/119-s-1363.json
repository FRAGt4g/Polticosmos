    "summary": "This bill, the 'New Mexico Land Grant-Mercedes Historical or Traditional Use Cooperation and Coordination Act,' aims to improve cooperation between the federal government and land grant-mercedes in New Mexico regarding historical or traditional land uses on federal land. It mandates a memorandum of understanding (MOU) outlining permit requirements, fee waivers, and coordination with the New Mexico Land Grant Council. The bill defines key terms, including 'community user' and 'historical or traditional use,' and specifies what activities are covered. It also requires consideration of these uses in land use planning and emphasizes that the act does not affect existing rights or the state's authority over resources.",
