    "summary": "The Orland Project Water Management Act amends the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1991. The bill allows the Secretary of the Interior to facilitate water transfers from the Orland Project to the Central Valley Project, upon request from the Orland Unit Water Users Association, without regard to water year type. It specifies that these transfers should not be considered a new benefit, affect existing water rights or pending applications, or create redirected impacts to the Orland Project from temporary contracts.",
