    "summary": "The Fisheries Modernization Act of 2025 amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to allow certain freshwater fisheries, including the red swamp and white river crawfish fisheries, to be eligible for fishery resource disaster relief. It defines \"infrastructure-related cause\" for disasters, expanding the scope of eligible events to include those caused by infrastructure failures like flood control systems. The bill also modifies the information required for disaster relief applications to include data specific to crawfish fisheries and related environmental factors.",
