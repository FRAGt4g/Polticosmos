    "summary": "The Protect American Beef Act aims to address what it perceives as an unfair trade advantage held by Australia in the Wagyu beef market. The bill calls for a 70% tariff on imported Australian Wagyu meat, semen, and conventional embryos, citing a currency exchange rate advantage for Australian producers. It also seeks to establish a reciprocal trade agreement, allowing the U.S. to export wagyu beef to Australia, which it currently cannot. The bill highlights the growth of the U.S. Wagyu industry and the market share currently held by Australian imports.",
