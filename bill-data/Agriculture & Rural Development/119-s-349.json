    "summary": "The Fire-Safe Electrical Corridors Act of 2025 aims to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to allow utilities to remove trees from around electrical lines on National Forest System land without a timber sale, streamlining vegetation management. It mandates that any proceeds from the sale of removed material go to the Secretary, less transportation costs. The bill ensures that this action aligns with existing land management plans and environmental regulations.",
