    "summary": "The Security and Oversight for International Landholdings Act of 2025 (SOIL Act) aims to increase oversight of foreign investment in U.S. agricultural land. It expands the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review to include transactions involving land held by countries posing national security risks or designated as non-market economies. The bill also prohibits federal assistance for agricultural land owned by such entities and enhances reporting requirements for foreign land holdings, mandating an annual report detailing foreign ownership by country and sector.",
