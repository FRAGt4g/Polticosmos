    "summary": "This bill, the SNAP Anti-Theft and Victim Compensation Act of 2025, amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to address theft of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. It grants the Department of Agriculture Inspector General expanded authority to investigate and coordinate efforts to combat benefit theft, including cyber-enabled crimes. The bill authorizes states to reimburse households whose benefits are stolen and establishes a civil penalty for unauthorized benefit access. Funds recovered from penalties will be used to offset reimbursement costs and enhance investigations.",
