    "summary": "The 'Protecting Agricultural Spaces Through Effective Ranching Strategies Act' (PASTURES Act) aims to limit the ability of the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to penalize livestock owners for grazing on certain federal lands. Specifically, the bill prevents penalties on lands where grazing is permitted and then prohibited, focusing on areas bordering private property and where a fence is not in place to prevent grazing. The Secretary is responsible for fence-related expenses. The bill defines key terms like 'covered lands,' 'grazing permit,' 'livestock,' and 'Secretary concerned'.",
