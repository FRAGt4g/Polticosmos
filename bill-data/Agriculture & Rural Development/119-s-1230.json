    "summary": "This bill, the Safeguarding American Food and Export Trade Yields Act of 2025 (SAFETY Act of 2025), aims to protect the use of common food names in foreign markets. It amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 by defining \"common name\" and providing examples (e.g., Asiago, Parmesan). The bill also requires the Secretary of Agriculture to work with the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate agreements to secure the right of U.S. producers to use these names abroad and mandates semi-annual briefings to relevant Congressional committees on these efforts.
