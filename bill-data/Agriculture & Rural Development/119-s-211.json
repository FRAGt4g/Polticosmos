    "summary": "The 'Resiliency for Ranching and Natural Conservation Health Act' amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. This bill focuses on improving the management of grazing permits and leases on federal lands. It allows the temporary use of vacant grazing allotments by permit holders affected by natural disasters or extreme events. It outlines conditions, coordination, and guidelines for this temporary use, ensuring it doesn't affect long-term allotment plans or animal unit months. The Secretary will establish guidelines for how this temporary use is implemented.",
