    "summary": "The Ranching Without Red Tape Act of 2025 aims to streamline the process for making range improvements on federal lands. It directs the Secretaries of Agriculture (USFS) and Interior (BLM) to issue regulations allowing permittees to undertake minor range improvements (fences, wells, etc.) after notifying the relevant agency. It also mandates the agencies respond to permittee requests for range improvements within 30 days and expedite approved projects. This aims to reduce bureaucratic hurdles for ranchers.",
