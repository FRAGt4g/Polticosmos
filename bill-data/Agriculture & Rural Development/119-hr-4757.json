    "summary": "The Pigs and Public Health Act aims to improve animal welfare and public health by addressing the handling and slaughter of nonambulatory pigs. It mandates humane treatment, bans the use of certain drugs, and sets standards for transportation. The bill also establishes an online portal for confidential complaints, provides whistleblower protection, and requires a study on the public health risks associated with nonambulatory pigs in the food system. It amends existing federal laws, including the Animal Health Protection Act, the Animal Welfare Act, the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, and the Federal Meat Inspection Act.",
