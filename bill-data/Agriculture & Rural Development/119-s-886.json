It amends the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978, increasing penalties, requiring due diligence, and mandating reports on land purchases by foreign entities. The bill focuses on national security concerns, particularly regarding China, and aims to prevent agricultural espionage, intellectual property theft, and threats to food security. It also establishes a database of foreign-owned agricultural land and prohibits foreign persons from participating in Farm Service Agency programs.",
