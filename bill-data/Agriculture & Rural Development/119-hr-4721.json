The program aims to address drinking water contamination in rural areas by providing financial aid to eligible end users and non-profit organizations for water quality tests, product purchases, installations, and maintenance. The bill defines key terms like \"eligible drinking water quality improvement product,\" and \"eligible end user\" and requires the Secretary to submit annual reports to Congress regarding the program's effectiveness.",
