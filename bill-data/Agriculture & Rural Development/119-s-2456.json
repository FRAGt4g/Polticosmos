    "summary": "The Promoting Rural Exports Act of 2025 aims to boost exports from rural businesses. It mandates the establishment of a National Rural Export Center and up to nine regional centers within the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service. These centers will provide market research, strategic planning, and export support services. They will collect data on program effectiveness (number of businesses assisted, services used, export value) and maintain websites to offer resources tailored to rural businesses.",
