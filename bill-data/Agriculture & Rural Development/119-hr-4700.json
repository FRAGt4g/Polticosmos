    "summary": "This bill, the Processing Revival and Intrastate Meat Exemption Act (PRIME Act), amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to exempt custom slaughter facilities from federal inspection requirements. It allows such facilities to slaughter animals and prepare meat products for intrastate commerce, provided they comply with state laws and distribute the meat to consumers and certain establishments within the state. The bill aims to increase meat processing options, particularly for local and small-scale producers. It explicitly states that the amendments do not preempt state laws on meat processing.",
