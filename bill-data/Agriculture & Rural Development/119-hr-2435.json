    "summary": "The Save Our Small Farms Act of 2025 aims to aid small farmers. It amends the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 by lowering noninsured crop disaster assistance costs, reducing paperwork, and increasing payouts. It also incentivizes farmers to transition to comprehensive insurance plans with premium discounts. The bill includes provisions for streamlined applications, revenue-based coverage, and expanded crop listings. Further, it introduces single index insurance policies tied to weather conditions for agricultural income losses and makes several adjustments to whole farm revenue protection policies and micro farm plans.",
