    "summary": "This bill, the Promoting Agriculture Safeguards and Security Act of 2025 (PASS Act), amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to include the Secretary of Agriculture on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). It mandates review of agriculture-related transactions by CFIUS, specifically concerning foreign investments in U.S. agricultural businesses and purchases of agricultural real estate. The President is required to prohibit transactions by covered foreign persons (e.g., from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea) that would result in control of U.S. agricultural assets, with a waiver possible for national security interests.  It also requires the Secretary of Agriculture to report on the risks of foreign purchases in the U.S. agricultural sector.",
