    "summary": "The Quinault Indian Nation Land Transfer Act proposes to transfer approximately 72 acres of land in Washington State from the Forest Service to the Department of the Interior, to be held in trust for the benefit of the Quinault Indian Nation. The land will become part of the Quinault Indian Reservation but is ineligible for gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The Act ensures treaty rights are unaffected and addresses hazardous materials disclosure, without requiring remediation by the Secretary of the Interior.",
