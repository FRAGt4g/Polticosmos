    "summary": "The Dairy Nutrition Incentive Program Act of 2025 aims to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to establish a dairy nutrition incentive program. This program, administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, will provide grants or cooperative agreements to eligible entities (states, local governments, and non-profits) to increase the purchase and consumption of naturally nutrient-rich dairy products by individuals using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. The bill defines key terms, outlines application and evaluation processes, specifies funding, and mandates reports to Congress. It also includes a transition plan for existing healthy fluid milk incentives projects.",
