    "summary": "The Strengthening Local Processing Act of 2025 aims to support small and very small meat and poultry processing establishments. The bill mandates the USDA to create resources like a searchable database of studies and model HACCP plans. It increases the federal share for state inspection expenses, expands cooperative interstate shipment programs, and establishes a processing resilience grant program and local meat and poultry processing training programs. These measures aim to enhance the capacity and resilience of local meat processing and address workforce development.",
