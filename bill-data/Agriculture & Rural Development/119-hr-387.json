    "summary": "The \"Texas Agricultural Producers Assistance Act\" (H.R. 387) directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report to Congress within 180 days of its enactment. The report must identify all existing Department of Agriculture programs and authorities that could provide financial assistance to Texas agricultural producers. These producers have incurred economic losses because Mexico has failed to deliver water to the United States as required by a 1944 international treaty. The bipartisan bill aims to catalog available federal support for these affected farmers without creating new programs or funding.",
