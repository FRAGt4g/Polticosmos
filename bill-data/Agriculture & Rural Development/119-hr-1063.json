    "summary": "This bill, the Farm Credit Administration Independent Authority Act, aims to solidify the Farm Credit Administration's (FCA) role as the sole regulator of the Farm Credit System. It mandates that Farm Credit System lenders collect and report demographic data (race, sex, and ethnicity) from small farmer loan applicants and borrowers, while protecting their personally identifiable information. The FCA is then required to make this anonymized data public annually. Additionally, the bill includes a conforming amendment and addresses the cessation of compliance if certain related regulations are invalidated.",
