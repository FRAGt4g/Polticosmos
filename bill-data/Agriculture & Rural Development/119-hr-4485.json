    "summary": "The Climate-Friendly Food Label Task Force Act establishes an advisory panel to study the development of a climate-friendly certification for agricultural products. The bill aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, promote sustainable practices, and leverage market-based approaches to drive innovation. The panel, composed of experts and representatives from various organizations and government agencies, will recommend criteria for certification, including lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and land use effects, with a report due to Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture within a year. A moratorium is placed on the USDA using climate-friendly certifications until the report is released.",
