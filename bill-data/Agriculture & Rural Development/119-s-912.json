    "summary": "The Securing American Agriculture Act mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to annually assess U.S. dependency on critical agricultural products and inputs sourced from China. The assessment must include domestic production capacity, supply chain vulnerabilities, and recommendations to reduce reliance on China. The act defines critical inputs broadly, provides guidelines for data collection and confidentiality, and ensures the assessment protects trade secrets. The aim is to bolster U.S. food security and supply chain resilience.",
