    "summary": "The Agriculture Resilience Act of 2025 aims to address climate change's impact on agriculture. It establishes national goals for emissions reduction (50% by 2030, net zero by 2040) and subgoals concerning research, soil health, farmland preservation, pasture-based livestock, on-farm renewable energy, and food loss/waste. The bill amends existing acts to establish programs, regional hubs, and grant opportunities focusing on sustainable agriculture, conservation practices, and renewable energy. It also addresses food labeling regarding quality and discard dates, federal food donation, and promotes composting, school food waste reduction and food waste research.",
