    "summary": "Violet's Law (H.R. 3246) amends the Animal Welfare Act to facilitate the adoption or non-laboratory placement of certain animals used in federal research. It mandates that federal research facilities establish standards for the adoption or placement of eligible animals (dogs, cats, primates, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits) no longer needed for research and deemed suitable for release to rescue organizations, sanctuaries, shelters, or individuals. The bill defines key terms like \"animal rescue organization,\" \"animal sanctuary,\" \"animal shelter,\" and \"eligible animal,\" and specifies requirements for suitability, including veterinary certification.",
