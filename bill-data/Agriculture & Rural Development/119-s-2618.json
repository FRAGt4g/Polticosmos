    "summary": "This bill, the 'More Opportunities for Rural Economies from USDA Grants Act,' aims to improve access to and utilization of USDA grant programs for rural communities. It focuses on 'High-Density Public Land Counties,' defined as counties with a population under 100,000 and where over 50% of the land is federally owned. The bill mandates a 50% reduction in local matching fund requirements for qualifying grant programs within these counties, provides technical assistance, and prioritizes applications from these areas. It also allows the Secretary of Agriculture to offer flexibility regarding application requirements and scoring criteria that may disadvantage small, isolated communities.",
