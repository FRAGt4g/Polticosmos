    "summary": "The Red Snapper Act of 2025 aims to prevent the Secretary of Commerce from implementing area closures in the South Atlantic for snapper-grouper fisheries until the South Atlantic Great Red Snapper Count study is complete and its data is integrated into stock assessments. The bill highlights the economic importance of fishing in the region, the recovered status of the red snapper stock, and the need for accurate data to inform management decisions, especially given the concerns of area closures on economic output. The bill is sponsored by Mr. Scott of Florida.",
