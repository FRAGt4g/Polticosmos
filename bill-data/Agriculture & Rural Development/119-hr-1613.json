    "summary": "The 'Protecting Mushroom Farmers Act' aims to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to mandate research and development of a federal crop insurance policy specifically for mushroom production. This includes insurance for mushroom growing media and mushrooms themselves, considering various risks like pests, pathogens, weather-related losses, and production phases. The bill requires the Corporation to carry out or contract research and development, and a report on the findings and recommendations must be submitted to the relevant congressional committees within two years.",
