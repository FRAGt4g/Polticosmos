The bill focuses on expanding access to third-party providers for technical help. It establishes certification processes for these providers, including non-Federal entities and State agencies. The legislation mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to streamline certification, set payment amounts for technical services, and improve data transparency. It also includes provision for review of the program and setting target utilization rates.",
