    "summary": "This bill, the \"Protecting Access for Hunters and Anglers Act of 2025,\" aims to prevent the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture from prohibiting the use of lead ammunition or tackle on federal land and water designated for hunting and fishing. Exceptions are made if specific units of land or water experience wildlife population decline linked to lead exposure, provided the regulations align with state laws and/or policies. The bill mandates a Federal Register notice explaining the rationale for any such limitations.",
