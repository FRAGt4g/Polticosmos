    "summary": "This bill, the Acequia Communities Empowered by Qualifying Upgrades for Infrastructure Act, aims to support acequia systems (community-ditch water distribution) in New Mexico. It amends the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 to ensure drought protection for farmers relying on acequias. It also exempts routine maintenance and minor improvements of acequias on federal land from requiring special use permits. Finally, it mandates a Department of Agriculture report on acequia systems, including drought vulnerability, program access and financial assistance.",
