    "summary": "The Wolf and Livestock Fairness Act of 2025 amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to provide financial relief to livestock producers impacted by Mexican gray wolf attacks. It increases indemnity payments to 100% of market value for livestock killed by these wolves.  The bill also mandates the Secretary of Agriculture develop a formula for providing emergency relief, considering factors like herd size, depredation rates, and management cost increases. The Secretary must consult with relevant agencies and report annually to Congress.",
