    "summary": "The Forest Data Modernization Act of 2025 amends the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of 1978 to update the forest inventory and analysis program. Key changes include expanding data collection methods (timber products output studies, woodland owner surveys), incorporating forest carbon data, establishing national consistency in standards and definitions, updating the strategic plan for data collection, ensuring data accessibility, and providing for biennial compilations of forest statistics. The bill also establishes a process for handling complex data requests and requires annual progress reports on the strategic plan.",
