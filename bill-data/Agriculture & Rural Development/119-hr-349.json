    "summary": "Goldie's Act amends the Animal Welfare Act to strengthen USDA enforcement. The bill defines \"violation,\" mandates annual and follow-up inspections of regulated facilities, and requires the prompt confiscation of animals found to be suffering. It increases transparency by requiring the USDA to share violation reports with local law enforcement within 24 hours. The act also increases civil penalties for violations to $10,000 per offense, per day, reforms hearing procedures, and establishes stricter guidelines for calculating fines to deter future non-compliance and protect animals from abuse and neglect at licensed facilities.",
