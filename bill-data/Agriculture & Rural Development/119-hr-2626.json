    "summary": "The Pigs In Gestation Stalls Act of 2025 aims to amend the Animal Welfare Act to prohibit the confinement of pregnant pigs in ways that restrict their movement or provide inadequate space. The bill sets different standards concerning the size of a pig's enclosure, specifies exceptions to this restriction, and includes penalties for violations. It also mandates financial assistance for pig producers to comply with the new requirements and prioritizes independent producers for such aid. Finally, the bill defines key terms like 'breeding pig' and 'enclosure' and clarifies that it doesn't preempt state or local animal welfare laws.",
