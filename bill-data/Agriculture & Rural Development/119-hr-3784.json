    "summary": "The Farmers Feeding America Act of 2025 amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983. It primarily focuses on increasing commodity availability and funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program through 2030, including a specific allocation of $500 million annually from 2026 to 2030. It also provides for alternative delivery options for geographically isolated states (Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, etc.) for the distribution of commodities and allows for direct purchase options. Additionally, it addresses fresh produce package procurement, considering factors beyond lowest price.",
