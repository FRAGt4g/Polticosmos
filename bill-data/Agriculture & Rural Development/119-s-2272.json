    "summary": "The Tribal Access to Clean Water Act of 2025 aims to provide access to reliable, clean, and drinkable water on Tribal lands and for the Native Hawaiian Community. The bill addresses funding gaps for existing infrastructure programs, authorizes appropriations for the Department of Agriculture and the Indian Health Service, and provides technical assistance. It amends existing legislation to include Native Hawaiian organizations and sets priorities for funding operation and maintenance, focusing on facilities most in need.  It also addresses water facility loans and grants, as well as the need for collaboration between federal agencies.",
