    "summary": "The Cape Fox Land Entitlement Finalization Act of 2025 aims to provide equitable treatment for the Cape Fox Village Corporation (a Native Village in Alaska). The bill waives certain land selection requirements, allows Cape Fox to select Federal land within the Tongass National Forest, and mandates the Secretary of the Interior to convey the land to Cape Fox. The subsurface estate of the land will be conveyed to Sealaska Corporation. The conveyance fulfills certain entitlements under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and includes a public access easement.",
