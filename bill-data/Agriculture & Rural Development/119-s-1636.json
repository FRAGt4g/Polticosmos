    "summary": "The Fence Line Fairness Act of 2025 aims to resolve property boundary disputes between private landowners and the government regarding National Forest System land. It mandates the Secretary of Agriculture, in collaboration with state agencies, to establish mediation committees in each state with National Forest System land. These committees, composed of private farmers/ranchers, will analyze disputes, provide recommendations, and submit reports to various parties, including congressional committees, with an emphasis on dispute resolution rather than litigation.",
