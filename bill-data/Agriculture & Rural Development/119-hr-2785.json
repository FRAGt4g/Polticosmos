    "summary": "This bill, the New Mexico Land Grant-Mercedes Historical or Traditional Use Cooperation and Coordination Act, aims to improve cooperation between the federal government and New Mexico's land grant-mercedes regarding historical and traditional land uses on federal land. It mandates memoranda of understanding (MOUs) between the Secretary of Agriculture/Interior and the New Mexico Land Grant Council to define permit processes, fee waivers, and land use planning related to activities like grazing, gathering resources, and maintaining cultural sites. The bill emphasizes that it doesn't affect existing rights, tribal rights, state water/fish regulations, or create new land use rights.",
