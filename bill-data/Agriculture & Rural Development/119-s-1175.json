    "summary": "The Small County PILT Parity Act amends section 6903 of title 31, United States Code, to adjust payments to low-population units of general local government. It primarily focuses on revising population tiers and associated payment limitations. The changes affect how the Payment In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, aimed at compensating local governments for the presence of federal lands, distributes funds, potentially increasing payments to smaller counties.",
