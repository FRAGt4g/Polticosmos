    "summary": "The Safe American Food Exports Act of 2025 aims to mitigate the impact of animal disease outbreaks on U.S. exports. The bill amends the Animal Health Protection Act, allowing the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the U.S. Trade Representative, to negotiate agreements regarding regionalization, zoning, and other measures with countries that import U.S. livestock and animal products. The bill emphasizes taking global research advances into account. It clarifies that this action doesn't restrict the USTR's ability to negotiate trade agreements. ",
