    "summary": "The Protecting American Farmland Act (H.R. 3313) aims to prevent the conversion of prime farmland for solar energy projects. It prohibits federal agencies from using funds for such projects and excludes property placed on prime farmland from various tax credits related to clean energy. This includes residential clean energy credits, renewable electricity production credits, clean electricity production credits, and energy credits, effectively discouraging solar development on farmland.",
