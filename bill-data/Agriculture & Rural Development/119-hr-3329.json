    "summary": "The Wildlife Corridors and USDA Conservation Programs Act of 2025 aims to conserve and designate habitat connectivity areas, termed 'American wildlife corridors', with support from the USDA.  The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture, in collaboration with other agencies, to identify and map these areas. It establishes criteria for designation, provides technical assistance and encourages conservation efforts, and allows for contract modifications within existing USDA conservation programs to further these goals. The goal is to facilitate wildlife movement and resilience to environmental changes.",
