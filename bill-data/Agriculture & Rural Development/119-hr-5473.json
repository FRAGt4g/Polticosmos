    "summary": "The Farm Rescue Act of 2025 amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to provide advance partial price loss coverage payments to farmers for the 2025 crop year. The Secretary of Agriculture will determine if such payments are needed based on market price projections. If so, producers can opt for a partial payment (40-50% of the projected price loss coverage payment) and a subsequent payment after the marketing year. The Act also mandates the Secretary to issue necessary rules within 60 days.",
