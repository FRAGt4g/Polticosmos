    "summary": "The Organic Imports Verification Act of 2025 mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to submit annual reports to Congress on residue testing of imported organic feedstuffs shipped in bulk. The bill defines \"covered organic feedstuff\" and outlines testing protocols, including frequency, methods, and results. It requires a risk-based approach for identifying feedstuffs for testing and specifies corrective actions if prohibited substances are detected. The act also outlines confidentiality provisions for the annual list and mandates that shipments with exceeding levels of residue are excluded from organic sale.",
