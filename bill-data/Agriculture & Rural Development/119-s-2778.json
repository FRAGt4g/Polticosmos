    "summary": "The Local School Foods Expansion Act of 2025 amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to establish a program for the procurement of domestically grown, unprocessed fruits and vegetables for school meals. It replaces the pilot project with a program, increases the number of participating states, and adds criteria for state selection, including support for small farmers, Tribal producers, and disadvantaged communities. The bill includes provisions for recordkeeping, reporting, program evaluation, and allocates funding for administrative costs, technical assistance, and outreach. This includes $25 million annually from 2026-2030.",
