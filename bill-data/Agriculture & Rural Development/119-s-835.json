    "summary": "The Reduce Food Loss and Waste Act of 2025 aims to establish a voluntary certification program under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. This program, overseen by the Secretary of Agriculture, will certify eligible participants (e.g., food producers, retailers) based on their efforts to reduce food loss and waste. The program's goals include increasing food donations to charities and promoting alternative disposal methods like composting. The bill mandates the establishment of criteria, accreditation processes for certifiers, and promotional activities, including voluntary labeling, and authorizes appropriations for implementation.",
