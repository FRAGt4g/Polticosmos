    "summary": "The Healthy Food Access for All Americans Act proposes a tax credit and grant program to stimulate investment and improve healthy food options in food deserts. It establishes a tax credit for qualified grocery stores and renovation areas, and a grant program for food banks and temporary access merchants. The bill outlines certification requirements for Special Access Food Providers, specifies grant allocation and recapture provisions, defines key terms (like \"food desert\" and \"grocery store\"), and mandates updates to the Food Access Research Atlas. It aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and authorize appropriations for the program, applying to taxable years after the Act's enactment.",
