    "summary": "The Agricultural Emergency Relief Act of 2025 mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a program providing financial aid to agricultural producers who experience crop losses due to natural disasters. It defines 'qualified losses' and sets eligibility criteria. Payment amounts depend on factors like insurance coverage and adjusted gross farm income, with limitations on total payment amounts and requiring future insurance purchase. The bill authorizes appropriations for the program from fiscal years 2025-2030 and allows for administrative costs.",
