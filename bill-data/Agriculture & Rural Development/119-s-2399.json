    "summary": "The Loggers Economic Assistance and Relief Act aims to provide financial aid to timber harvesting and timber hauling businesses that suffer significant revenue losses due to major disasters, including insect infestations. It establishes a payment program administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, offering payments equal to 10% of lost gross revenue if losses exceed 10% in a 30-day period or quarter. The bill mandates the Secretary to issue reports and sets an appropriation of $50,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2025-2029. The bill specifically focuses on providing aid to businesses and does not offer any funding on education about timber harvesting.",
