    "summary": "The Wildfire Resilience Through Grazing Research Act (S. 602) aims to amend the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to support research and development of ungulate grazing land management techniques. This includes grants for land-grant institutions to study how grazing can mitigate wildfires, reduce fuel loads, aid post-fire recovery, and improve soil health. The bill also focuses on disseminating information to landowners and managers on these techniques and compatible environmental practices, such as rotational grazing and riparian buffer zones.",
