    "summary": "This bill, the 'Forest Conservation Easement Program Act of 2025,' amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to establish a forest conservation easement program. It aims to protect forest land and natural resources through conservation easements, promoting biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and watershed protection. The program provides financial assistance to eligible entities and landowners for purchasing easements and developing forest management plans. It also repeals the Healthy Forests Restoration Act and provides for transitional provisions for existing contracts. The bill allocates funds for the program and specifies prioritization criteria for applications and establishes program eligibility requirements.",
