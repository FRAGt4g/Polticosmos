    "summary": "The Landowner Easement Rights Act aims to limit the duration of conservation easements entered into by the Secretary of the Interior to a maximum of 30 years. It also grants landowners the right to renegotiate existing easements, receive a detailed map and fair market value assessment, and potentially buy back their easements. The bill defines conservation easements, excluding agreements with Indian Tribes and those related to utilities, and specifies conditions under which landowners must be notified of their rights.",
