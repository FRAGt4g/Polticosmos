    "summary": "This bill amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to improve coordination between the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture. It mandates the Administrator consult with the Secretary of Agriculture on risk mitigation measures, including economic analyses of costs and benefits. It also requires coordination on data and information used in pesticide registration, and mandates collaboration with the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce on actions related to endangered species. Finally, it allows for waivers of these coordination requirements under certain conditions.",
