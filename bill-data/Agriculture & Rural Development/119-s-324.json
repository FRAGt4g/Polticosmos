These projects aim to improve subseasonal to seasonal forecasting for agriculture and water management, focusing on areas like precipitation, atmospheric rivers, and air-sea interactions. The bill specifies objectives, activities, and a five-year sunset clause. It authorizes $45 million annually from 2025 through 2029 for these activities.",
