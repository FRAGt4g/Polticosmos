The bill states that if 75% or more of a person's average adjusted gross income comes from farming, ranching, or silviculture activities (including agri-tourism and related activities), they are exempt from payment limits on benefits outlined in the Agricultural Act of 2014 and the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996.",
