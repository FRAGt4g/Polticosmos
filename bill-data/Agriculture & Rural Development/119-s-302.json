    "summary": "The Snap Back Inaccurate SNAP Payments Act aims to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to improve the calculation and reduce taxpayer costs associated with payment errors in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). It introduces changes to the quality control system, including setting a $0 tolerance for small errors in 2025 and beyond. The bill also modifies how payment error rates are calculated to account for recouped overpayments and mandates state agencies to actively recover those overpayments.",
