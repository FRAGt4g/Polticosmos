    "summary": "This bill, the \"Fair Milk Pricing for Farmers Act,\" amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to increase transparency in the dairy industry. It requires dairy product manufacturers to report their production costs and product yields for all items processed in their facilities. The legislation mandates that the Secretary of Agriculture collect this data and publish it in a public report every two years, starting three years after the bill's enactment. The aim is to provide farmers and the public with clearer insight into the economics of the dairy supply chain, potentially leading to fairer milk pricing for dairy farmers.",
