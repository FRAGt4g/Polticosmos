    "summary": "The Strong Farms, Strong Future Act (H.R. 4428) amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to promote conservation practices through the Conservation Stewardship Program. The bill focuses on providing additional payments to producers who adopt or improve perennial production systems. Key provisions include defining perennial production systems, establishing climate change mitigation bundles, adjusting payments for inflation, and requiring a report on the adoption of these bundles. The goal is to improve soil health, increase carbon sequestration, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through agricultural practices.",
