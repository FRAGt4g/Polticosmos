    "summary": "The Social Security Overpayment Relief Act (H.R. 2142) aims to limit the recovery of Social Security overpayments under Titles II (retirement, survivors, and disability insurance) and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act. The bill proposes that the government cannot recover overpayments from individuals if the overpayment occurred more than ten years prior to the date the Commissioner of Social Security identifies the overpayment. This provides relief to beneficiaries from long-standing overpayment debts.",
