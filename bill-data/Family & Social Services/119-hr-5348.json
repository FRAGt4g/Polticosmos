    "summary": "The Social Security Child Protection Act of 2025 amends the Social Security Act to address instances where a child's social security account number has been compromised. It allows for the reissuance of a new social security number to children under 14 if a parent or guardian provides evidence, under penalty of perjury, demonstrating the number's confidentiality was breached, typically due to a lost or stolen social security card. This is designed to protect children from potential identity theft or misuse of their information. The act will take effect 180 days after enactment.",
