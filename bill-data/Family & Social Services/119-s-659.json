    "summary": "The 'Generate Recordings of All Child Protective Interviews Everywhere Act' (GRACIE Act of 2025) proposes a grant program administered by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. This program will provide funds to states that mandate the recording and secure storage (for at least 5 years) of all child welfare interviews, including initial assessments. The recordings will be accessible to investigators, and, with some limitations, to caregivers and guardians in legal proceedings. The bill defines key terms like 'child welfare interview' and 'eligible entity', and specifies how grants can be used.",
