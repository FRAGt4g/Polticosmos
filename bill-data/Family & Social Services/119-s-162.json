    "summary": "The 'Recruiting Families Using Data Act of 2025' aims to improve foster and adoptive parent recruitment and retention. It amends the Social Security Act to require states to develop family partnership plans, focusing on data-driven strategies for identifying, recruiting, supporting, and retaining foster and adoptive families. This includes plans for child-specific recruitment, engaging youth, and addressing challenges related to racial and ethnic representation within foster care. The bill also mandates the inclusion of data related to foster and adoptive families in the annual child welfare outcomes report to Congress.",
