    "summary": "The 'Protect TANF Resources for Families Act' aims to ensure that federal funds allocated for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs are used to supplement, not supplant, state spending. The bill amends the Social Security Act, prohibiting states from using federal TANF funds to replace state general revenue. It also requires the chief executive officer of each state to certify that TANF funds will not be used in this way. Additionally, the bill reauthorizes TANF activities through September 30, 2026, using funding levels from fiscal year 2023.",
