    "summary": "The End Diaper Need Act of 2025 aims to provide targeted funding through the Social Services Block Grant program to address the financial burden on families struggling to provide diapers and incontinence supplies for infants, toddlers, medically complex children, and adults with disabilities. It increases funding for states, allowing them to distribute supplies and support outreach programs. The bill also amends the tax code to include medically necessary diapers and diapering supplies as qualified medical expenses for health savings accounts, Archer MSAs, and health flexible spending arrangements, effective January 1, 2026. The bill also includes provisions for evaluation and reporting on the program's effectiveness.",
