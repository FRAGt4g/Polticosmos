    "summary": "The Families\u2019 Rights and Responsibilities Act aims to protect parental rights regarding the upbringing, education, and healthcare of their children as a fundamental right. It asserts that government interference in these areas should be limited and subject to strict scrutiny, requiring a compelling governmental interest and the least restrictive means. The bill defines key terms, outlines exceptions, provides for judicial remedies, and amends existing laws to support parental rights, while acknowledging parental responsibilities as outlined in Supreme Court rulings. It emphasizes broad protection of parental rights and applies to federal laws.",
