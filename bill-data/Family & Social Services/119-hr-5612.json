    "summary": "The Cost-of-Living Fairness Act mandates that payments made by individuals for certain insurance policies (auto, homeowner/renter, and flood) are deducted from their income and resources when determining eligibility for federal, state, or local benefits and assistance programs. This aims to ensure that insurance costs aren't a barrier to accessing necessary aid by accurately assessing an individual's financial capacity.",
