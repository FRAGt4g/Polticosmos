    "summary": "The 'Adoption Information Act' (H.R. 215) amends Title V of the Social Security Act. It requires family planning projects receiving federal funds to provide informational pamphlets on adoption. Prepared annually by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, these pamphlets must list contact information for all regional adoption centers. They must be given to any person inquiring about family planning or abortion services, who must also be given an opportunity to read them. The bill specifies that no additional funds will be appropriated to implement this mandate.",
