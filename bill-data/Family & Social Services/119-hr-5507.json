    "summary": "This bill, the Hidden Foster Care Transparency Act, mandates that states report data on hidden foster care arrangements. It defines these arrangements as separations of children from parents without court orders or formal foster care involvement. States must report on the number of such arrangements, their outcomes, the types of allegations involved, services provided, legal counsel offered, and the duration of the arrangements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will compile an annual report to Congress based on the state data.",
