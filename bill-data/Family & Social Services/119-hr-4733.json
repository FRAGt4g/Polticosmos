    "summary": "This bill, the Low-Income Household Water Assistance Program Establishment Act, authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program providing grants to states and Indian tribes. These grants will help low-income households pay for drinking water and wastewater services, covering arrearages and other rates. The bill defines key terms like 'low-income household' and 'public water system,' and outlines grant distribution based on poverty levels and housing costs. Additionally, it provides grants to qualified non-profit organizations for assisting owners/operators of public water systems or treatment works in rural, underserved areas or in the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe. It also includes limitations on how funds can be used and authorizes $500M annually for fiscal years 2026-2030.",
