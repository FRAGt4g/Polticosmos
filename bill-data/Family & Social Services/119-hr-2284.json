    "summary": "The \"Reduce Bureaucracy to Uplift Families Act\" aims to amend the Social Security Act, specifically Title IV, Part A, concerning block grants for temporary assistance for needy families (TANF). The bill seeks to limit the percentage of funds that states can use for administrative expenses, reducing the allowable percentage and expanding the definition of administrative expenses to include case management. The bill also introduces penalties for non-compliance with these new limits, and sets an effective date. This is intended to encourage more funds to go to the needy and reduce wasteful spending.",
