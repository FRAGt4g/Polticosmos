    "summary": "The \"People-Centered Assistance Reform Effort Act\" or \"People CARE Act\" establishes a bipartisan commission to conduct a comprehensive review of all federal means-tested welfare programs. The commission's purpose is to find ways to streamline and consolidate programs, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and eliminate \"benefit cliffs\" that can disincentivize work. Its ultimate goal is to reform the social safety net to better promote employment, family stability, and self-sufficiency. The commission will submit a report and a single legislative bill to Congress, which will receive expedited, amendment-free consideration for an up-or-down vote.",
