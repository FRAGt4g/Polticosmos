    "summary": "This bill, the \"Drug Testing for Welfare Recipients Act,\" mandates drug screening and testing for individuals over 18 applying for specific federal benefits. It targets the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and federal housing assistance programs. Applicants with a drug-related arrest in the past five years, or those deemed high-risk via a screening questionnaire, must pass a drug test to receive benefits. A failed test results in a one-year benefit denial, or until the individual completes treatment and tests clean. States failing to enforce these rules face a 15% cut in related federal funds.",
