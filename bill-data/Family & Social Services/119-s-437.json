    "summary": "The \"Caring for All Families Act\" amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and Title 5 of the United States Code to expand the definition of family members for whom employees can take leave to include domestic partners, parents-in-law, adult children, and other individuals with close familial bonds. It also allows employees to take additional leave for parental involvement in children's activities and to meet family wellness needs, like attending medical appointments or caring for elderly relatives. These changes apply to both private and federal employees.",
