    "summary": "The Tribal Adoption Parity Act (S. 757) amends the Internal Revenue Code to recognize Indian tribal governments when determining if a child has special needs for the purposes of the adoption tax credit. This allows tribal governments to certify children with special needs, expanding access to the adoption tax credit for families adopting from tribal communities. The bill's amendments apply to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment.",
