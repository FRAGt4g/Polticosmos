    "summary": "The \"Keeping Our Field Offices Open Act\" aims to prevent the closure or consolidation of Social Security Administration field and hearing offices and resident stations, and to limit any new restrictions on public access to these locations. The bill institutes a moratorium on such actions, with exceptions for emergencies. It mandates a report to Congress justifying any potential future closures or consolidations, including detailed analysis and public hearings. The bill also sets requirements for these offices, requiring public notice, hearings, and a detailed final report to Congress before action can be taken.",
