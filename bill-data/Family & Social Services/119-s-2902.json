    "summary": "This bill, the Hidden Foster Care Transparency Act, mandates that states measure and publicly report on separations of children from their parents through 'hidden foster care arrangements.' These arrangements involve children separated from caregivers without court orders or formal foster care involvement. The bill requires states to submit data on the number of children affected, the nature of allegations, services provided, and outcomes, including reunification, entry into formal foster care, or other placements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is tasked with compiling an annual report to Congress based on the state-submitted data, promoting data standardization and providing guidance and technical assistance to states.",
