    "summary": "The Unborn Child Support Act amends the Social Security Act to allow for child support enforcement for unborn children. It mandates states establish and enforce child support obligations of a biological father to the mother from the first month of conception, if requested. Payments can be collected retroactively, with the amount determined by a court. Paternity measures require the mother's consent and cannot pose risks to the unborn child. The Act defines \"unborn child\" broadly and limits waiver authority for related experimental projects. It takes effect two years after enactment.",
