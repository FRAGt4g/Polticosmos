    "summary": "The Unborn Child Support Act amends the Social Security Act to include unborn children in the child support enforcement program. It allows mothers to seek child support from the biological father of an unborn child, with obligations potentially starting from the month of conception. The bill outlines conditions for establishing and enforcing these obligations, including court determination of payment amounts and a requirement for the mother's consent for paternity measures. It also places limitations on waivers for experimental projects related to child support enforcement.",
