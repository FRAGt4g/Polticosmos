    "summary": "The 'Small Business Child Care Investment Act' aims to allow nonprofit child care providers to access Small Business Administration (SBA) loan programs. It defines 'covered nonprofit child care provider' and outlines eligibility criteria, including compliance with licensing requirements, 501(c)(3) status, and size standards. The bill amends the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act to include these providers in certain loan programs while prohibiting direct lending by the SBA. It also mandates the SBA to report annually to Congress on the loan usage by these providers, including the number and amount of loans. Restrictions are in place to prevent discrimination and the use of loan proceeds for religious activities.",
