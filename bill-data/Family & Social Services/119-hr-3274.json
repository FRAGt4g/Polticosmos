    "summary": "The Child Care Infrastructure Act aims to improve child care facilities by providing grants. It mandates needs assessments of existing facilities, focusing on infrastructure, capacity, and costs. Grants are awarded to states and intermediary organizations (e.g., CDFIs) for facility acquisition, construction, and renovation, prioritizing low-income populations and underserved areas. Grants are subject to labor standards (Davis-Bacon Act). The bill authorizes $10 billion in appropriations, with allocations for Indian tribes, territories, and intermediary organizations.",
