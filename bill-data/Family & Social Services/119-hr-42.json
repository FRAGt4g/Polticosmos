    "summary": "This bill, the 'Alaska Native Settlement Trust Eligibility Act,' amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to protect the eligibility of certain Alaska Natives for government aid. For a five-year period, it would exclude payments from a Native Settlement Trust when determining the eligibility of aged, blind, or disabled Alaska Natives (and their descendants) for benefit programs. This ensures that trust payments do not inadvertently disqualify these vulnerable individuals from other essential support programs, as defined by the Social Security Act.",
