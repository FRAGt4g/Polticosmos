    "summary": "This bill, HR 571, proposes to amend the Social Security Act to means-test certain child's insurance benefits. Specifically, it targets benefits for children aged 18 or older who are full-time students. These children would not be eligible for benefits based on the earnings of a parent who is receiving old-age or disability benefits, is 67 or older, and earns more than $125,000 annually. The amendment would apply to benefits paid for any month beginning after the date of the bill's enactment.",
