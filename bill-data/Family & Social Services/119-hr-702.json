    "summary": "This bill, the \"Improving Federal Assistance to Families Act,\" aims to modify how the poverty line is calculated and used. It mandates the Bureau of the Census to create and publish a \"Regionally Adjusted Poverty Line\" for each state, accounting for regional cost of living variations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will then use this adjusted line, or the existing one, to determine eligibility for federal programs, with specific flexibility for the Affordable Care Act.  Furthermore, the bill calls for a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on the \"ALICE\" threshold (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed), an alternative poverty measure, to assess its potential for improving household need assessment.",
