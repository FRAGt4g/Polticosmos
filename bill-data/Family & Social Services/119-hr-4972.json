    "summary": "This bill, the Create Accountable Respectful Environments (CARE) for Children Act, amends part E of title IV of the Social Security Act to address the shortage of foster homes. It focuses on placing foster children in 'cottage family homes,' defining these homes and outlining their requirements.  The bill also allows for foster care maintenance payments for children in these homes, emphasizes keeping sibling groups together, and mandates checks for child safety and well-being. It includes provisions for effective dates and acknowledges state flexibility.",
