    "summary": "The 'Building Child Care for a Better Future Act' amends the Social Security Act to boost child care funding. It increases funding for the Child Care Entitlement to States, with specific allocations for Indian tribes and territories.  It then establishes grants to improve child care workforce, supply, quality, and access, especially in areas with particular need. These grants support various activities like workforce training, facility improvements, and wage enhancements, all managed through the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. The Act includes reporting requirements and evaluations of the impact of these initiatives.",
