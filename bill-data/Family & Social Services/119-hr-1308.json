    "summary": "The Family Income Supplemental Credit Act (FISC Act) proposes monthly payments to eligible pregnant women and parents to help support families. Applications are submitted to the Commissioner of Social Security, with payment amounts varying based on the presence of a pregnancy or the age of an eligible child. These payments are subject to income-based phase-outs and a marriage bonus. The bill also establishes the Bureau of Family Statistics within the Social Security Administration, and it repeals the existing child tax credit, making conforming amendments to the Internal Revenue Code and title 31 of the United States Code.",
