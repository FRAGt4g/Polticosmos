    "summary": "This bill, the Recruiting Families Using Data Act of 2025, aims to improve foster and adoptive parent recruitment and retention. It amends the Social Security Act to require states to develop family partnership plans that identify, recruit, screen, license, support, and retain foster and adoptive families. These plans must involve various stakeholders, use data to assess needs and measure progress, and address challenges related to recruiting and supporting families. The bill also mandates the inclusion of specific data regarding foster and adoptive families in the annual child welfare outcomes report to Congress.",
