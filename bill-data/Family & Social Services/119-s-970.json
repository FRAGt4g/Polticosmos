    "summary": "The 'Helping More Families Save Act' establishes a pilot program to improve the Family Self-Sufficiency Program. It allows eligible entities to establish and manage interest-bearing escrow accounts for low-income families receiving housing assistance (Section 8 or 9) whose rent increases due to earned income increases. Families can withdraw funds after five to seven years and income recertification happens at least annually. The bill also includes provisions for non-discrimination based on program participation, a study of the pilot's effectiveness, and authorization of appropriations.",
