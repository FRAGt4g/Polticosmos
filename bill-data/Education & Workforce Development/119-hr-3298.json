    "summary": "The 'Know Before You Owe Federal Student Loan Act of 2025' amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise student loan counseling requirements. Key changes include renaming 'Entrance Counseling' to 'Pre-Loan Counseling,' requiring students to manually enter the loan amount they wish to borrow, and mandating quarterly statements during periods when loan payments are not required. The bill aims to provide borrowers with more comprehensive information about their loans, including estimated monthly payments, debt-to-income ratios, and options for reducing borrowing.",
