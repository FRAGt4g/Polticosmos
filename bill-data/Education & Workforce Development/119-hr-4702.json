It mandates that the Administrator of the National Fire Academy submit an annual report to Congress. This report, due by November 30th each year, will detail the courses and programs offered by the Academy, including the number of participating fire departments, personnel demographics (career vs. volunteer), course cancellations, and the allocation of funds under specific subsections of the Act. The bill primarily aims to increase transparency and accountability for the Academy's activities.",
