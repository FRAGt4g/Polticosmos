    "summary": "The Flight Education Access Act amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to increase federal student loan limits for students in flight education and training programs. It defines \"eligible student\" and \"eligible undergraduate flight education and training program,\" specifies loan limits based on student dependency status and year of program completion, mandates data collection on program completion rates. The bill also requires disclosure requirements for loans, a GAO report on the implementation of the act, and authorizes appropriations for the Secretary of Education. Finally, the bill does not affect existing pilot training provisions.",
