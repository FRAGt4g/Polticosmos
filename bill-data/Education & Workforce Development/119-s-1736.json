    "summary": "This bill, the Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act of 2025, amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. It mandates specific requirements for training programs for local food service personnel, including scheduling during paid working hours, in-person training when appropriate, experiential learning, and no cost to the personnel. It also outlines provisions for training outside regular hours, including compensation and non-discrimination. The bill ensures that training does not supersede existing employment laws.",
