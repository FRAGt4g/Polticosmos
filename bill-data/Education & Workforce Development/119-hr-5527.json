    "summary": "The 'Stop Censoring Military Families Act' addresses curriculum and material access in schools operated by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA). It mandates the restoration of materials available before January 20, 2025, and restricts future limitations. The bill requires a report on material removal processes and amends existing law to limit the Secretary of Defense's ability to issue directives affecting DoDEA schools, outlining specific notice and review procedures. It also nullifies several Executive Orders, and mandates a study on creating an independent body to implement educational curricula for DODEA schools.",
