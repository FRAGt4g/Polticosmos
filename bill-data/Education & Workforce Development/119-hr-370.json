    "summary": "The Voluntary School Prayer Protection Act of 2025 (H.R. 370) proposes to prevent the Department of Education from providing federal funds to any state or local educational agency that has a policy denying, or that effectively prevents, voluntary participation in constitutionally protected prayer in public schools. The bill also explicitly states that no person can be required to participate in prayer or influence the form or content of any prayer activity, ensuring that such participation remains entirely voluntary.",
