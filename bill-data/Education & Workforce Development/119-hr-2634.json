    "summary": "The 'Free Speech On Campus Act' aims to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to ensure public institutions of higher education protect students' First Amendment rights. The bill mandates that these institutions provide a written statement and educational programming to new and transfer students during orientation. This includes explaining First Amendment rights, affirming the commitment to freedom of expression, and describing institutional policies protecting free speech. Additionally, the statement must be publicly available on the institution's website.",
