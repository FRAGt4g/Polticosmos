    "summary": "The Student Debt Alternative and CTE Awareness Act aims to increase awareness of career and technical education (CTE) programs as alternatives to traditional 4-year degrees. It mandates the Secretary of Education to publish information on CTE programs on the Office of Federal Student Aid website, including costs, completion times, and employment rates, and opportunities for funding. The bill also requires the FAFSA application to include a summary of this information and an acknowledgment, and prohibits additional funding for the Act.",
