    "summary": "The 'Counseling Not Criminalization in Schools Act' aims to divert federal funding away from police presence in schools and towards evidence-based, trauma-informed services for marginalized students. The bill prohibits federal funds for hiring, training, or maintaining law enforcement officers in schools. It establishes a grant program for local educational agencies to replace police with mental health professionals and reform school safety policies. The bill highlights the negative impacts of police presence on students, particularly students of color and students with disabilities, and focuses on creating safer and more inclusive learning environments.",
