    "summary": "The bill, titled the \"Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act of 2025,\" seeks to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. It mandates that training programs for local food service personnel be readily available, appropriate in format (including in-person options and experiential learning), and free of charge. The bill also addresses training outside of regular working hours, stipulating compensation, consultation with personnel, and no penalties for non-attendance. It emphasizes that the provisions do not supersede existing employment laws.",
