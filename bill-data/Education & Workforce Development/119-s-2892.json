Funds are allocated to eligible entities (partnerships between higher education and local educational agencies) and States, with a portion reserved for national activities. Grants support activities like curriculum development, student support services, and outreach. The bill emphasizes serving underrepresented students and requires reporting on program outcomes, with a national evaluation also mandated.",
