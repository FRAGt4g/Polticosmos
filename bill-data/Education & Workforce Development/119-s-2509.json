    "summary": "This bill, the Transparency in Reporting of Adversarial Contributions to Education Act, aims to increase transparency regarding foreign influence in public schools. It mandates that local educational agencies provide parents with the right to review and copy curricular materials, know the number of compensated personnel using foreign funds, and be informed of donations, agreements, and financial transactions with foreign countries or entities of concern. Schools must post a notice of these rights, and the Secretary of Education must notify state agencies of the requirements.",
