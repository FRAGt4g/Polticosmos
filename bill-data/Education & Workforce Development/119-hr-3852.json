    "summary": "The Reimagining Inclusive Arts Education Act authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to eligible entities (local and state educational agencies, and partnerships) to provide professional development for arts educators and creative arts therapists. The goal is to improve the inclusion of children with disabilities in arts education through curricula, best practices, and innovative approaches (including creative arts therapies). Grant periods are up to 3 years, with potential renewals, and prioritize schools receiving Title I funding.  The act defines relevant terms such as 'child with a disability' and 'creative arts therapist' and authorizes $15 million in appropriations for fiscal years 2026-2030.",
