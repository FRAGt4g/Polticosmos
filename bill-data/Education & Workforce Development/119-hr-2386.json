    "summary": "The 'Make Education Great Again Act' aims to improve education outcomes by empowering parents, states, and local communities. It focuses on school choice, reducing federal overreach, and promoting parental rights. The bill allows the Secretary of Education to reduce spending, review regulations, and support policies like education savings accounts. It also mandates quarterly reports on unspent funds. The bill emphasizes that it does not mandate curricula, limit parental rights, or authorize new federal spending, and it should not adversely affect homeschooling.",
