    "summary": "The Artificial Intelligence Literacy and Inclusion Act aims to promote AI literacy through programs funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The bill directs the NSF to award grants to eligible entities to develop and implement AI literacy programs at the local level, focusing on marginalized communities. It also mandates reports to Congress from various federal agencies (Labor, Commerce, Small Business Administration, and Education) detailing strategies to integrate AI literacy into workforce development, business competitiveness, education, and national security initiatives. Additionally, the agencies must identify existing awards that could be modified to support AI literacy.",
