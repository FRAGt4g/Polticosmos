    "summary": "The Employer Participation in Repayment Act (S.772) proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The primary objective is to make permanent the existing exclusion from gross income for certain employer payments of student loans under educational assistance programs. This change, if enacted, would allow employees to continue benefitting from tax-free employer contributions towards their student loan debt. The bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Warner and Senator Thune and referred to the Committee on Finance.",
