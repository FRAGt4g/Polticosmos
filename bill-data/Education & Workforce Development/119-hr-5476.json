    "summary": "The Preparing And Retaining All (PARA) Educators Act directs the Secretary of Education to create a grant program for state educational agencies (SEAs) to support the recruitment and retention of paraprofessionals in public elementary, secondary schools, and preschool programs. Grants are allocated based on a state's share of funding under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Funds can be used for various activities, including mentoring, professional development, increasing wages, and providing certifications. Priority is given to entities serving low-income families and those located in specific locales. SEAs must submit applications and provide annual reports on paraprofessional pay, retention efforts, and professional development programs. The bill authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2026-2030.",
