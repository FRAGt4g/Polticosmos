    "summary": "The 'Pipeline to Service Act' aims to expand employment opportunities in Executive agencies for recent graduates, particularly through the Presidential Management Fellows Program. The bill establishes a program within the Office of Personnel Management to partner with higher education institutions for student recruitment and appointment to agency positions, including providing career advising, professional development, and resume assistance. It mandates a minimum hourly wage for interns and requires the OPM to publish demographic information on interns and program participants. The bill also revises the Presidential Management Fellows Program, including defining qualifications, establishing agency processes, outlining development activities, and detailing promotion and conversion to competitive service processes.",
