    "summary": "The \"Impact Aid Infrastructure Partnership Act\" aims to provide federal funding in partnership with local communities to address facility needs of federally impacted local educational agencies. It authorizes $250 million annually for four years, with 75% allocated for competitive grants and 25% for formula grants. The bill prioritizes schools with critical needs, such as those violating safety codes or lacking adequate infrastructure. Grant awards hinge on facility condition and the ability of the district to provide a local match based on financial need, with a focus on rural areas where costs are often higher.",
