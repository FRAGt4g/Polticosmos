    "summary": "The Seizure Awareness and Preparedness Act amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a grant program to support students with epilepsy and seizure disorders.  Grants will be awarded to states, who will then provide subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs). The funds will primarily be used for training school personnel on seizure awareness, preparedness, individualized health/emergency care plans, and also covering the administration of seizure medications. The bill outlines required information for individual care plans, specifies training requirements for school nurses and bus drivers, and includes liability protections for school staff. It authorizes $34.5 million in appropriations for fiscal years 2026-2030.",
