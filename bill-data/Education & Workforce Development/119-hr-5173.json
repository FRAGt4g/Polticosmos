    "summary": "The No Social Media at School Act mandates that social media companies use geofencing to block access to their platforms on K-12 school campuses during school hours. Exceptions are made for emergency alerts. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is empowered to enforce the act, with state attorneys general also having the ability to bring civil actions. The bill defines social media platforms and includes exemptions to that definition, aiming to protect student privacy and promote a safe educational environment by limiting access to these digital platforms during school hours.",
