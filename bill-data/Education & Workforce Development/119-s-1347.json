    "summary": "The Making Education Affordable and Accessible Act of 2025 aims to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to increase access to dual or concurrent enrollment programs and early college high schools. It authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to eligible institutions to support these programs, particularly those serving low-income, rural, or first-generation college students. The bill outlines the permissible uses of grant funds, including professional development, course design, and outreach programs. It also mandates program evaluations and reports to Congress on the programs' effectiveness.",
