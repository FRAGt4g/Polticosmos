    "summary": "The 'Ensuring Safer Schools Act of 2025' aims to increase school safety by prioritizing the hiring and training of veterans and retired law enforcement officers as school resource officers. It amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to allow COPS grants for this purpose, provide preferential consideration for related applications, mandate mental health screenings and training for officers, and define 'school resource officer' more broadly. It also requires coordination between the Department of Veterans Affairs and grant recipients to connect veterans with law enforcement agencies.",
