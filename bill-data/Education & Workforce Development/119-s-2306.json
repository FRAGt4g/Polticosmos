    "summary": "The STEM RESTART Act (S. 2306) amends the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to create a national program supporting mid-career workers re-entering the STEM workforce. It provides grants to small and medium-sized STEM businesses for paid internships or returnships that lead to above-entry-level positions. The bill defines key terms like 'returnship' and 'rural area,' outlines eligibility criteria for businesses and providers, and details application requirements, funding amounts, and reporting obligations. It authorizes $50 million annually from 2026-2030.",
