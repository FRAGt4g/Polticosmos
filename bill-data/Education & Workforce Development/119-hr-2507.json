    "summary": "The Helping to Encourage Real Opportunities (HERO) for Youth Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the work opportunity credit for youth employees. It expands the credit for summer youth employment to include year-round employment, increases the credit amount, and introduces a credit for 'disconnected youth,' defined as individuals aged 16-25 who have not been regularly attending school or employed in the prior six months. The bill aims to incentivize employers to hire these target groups.",
