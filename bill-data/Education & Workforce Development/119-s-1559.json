    "summary": "The 'Know Before You Owe Federal Student Loan Act of 2025' amends the Higher Education Act of 1965. Key provisions include revising pre-loan counseling requirements to provide borrowers with more comprehensive information, such as estimated monthly payments and debt-to-income ratios. It mandates that students confirm the exact loan amount they wish to borrow. The bill also requires lenders to provide quarterly statements to borrowers during periods when loan payments are not required, detailing loan information and payment options. Conforming amendments are also made regarding program participation agreements and regulatory relief.",
