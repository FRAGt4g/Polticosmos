    "summary": "This bill, the Supporting Accurate Views of Emergency Services Act of 2025 (911 SAVES Act of 2025), aims to have the Director of the Office of Management and Budget revise the Standard Occupational Classification System. The revision would consider creating a separate code for public safety telecommunicators, recognizing them as protective service occupations. The bill highlights the critical role of these telecommunicators in emergency response, emphasizing their impact and the need for accurate classification. If the Director chooses not to establish a separate code, a report to Congress is required.",
