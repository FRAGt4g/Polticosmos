It establishes block grants to states for elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education, with conditions on data submission, audits, and compliance with civil rights laws. Funds will be allocated based on student enrollment. The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will oversee civil rights enforcement. The bill authorizes appropriations based on the Department of Education's 2019 budget, with allocations for block grants and federal agency administration.",
