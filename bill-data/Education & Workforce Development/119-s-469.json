    "summary": "The Family Farm and Small Business Exemption Act aims to exclude family farms and small businesses from being considered 'assets' when calculating financial aid eligibility under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The bill amends section 480(f)(2) of the Higher Education Act to implement this change, specifically applying to need analysis for award years starting on or after the bill's enactment. It defines eligible businesses as those with no more than 100 full-time or equivalent employees and owned/controlled by a family.",
