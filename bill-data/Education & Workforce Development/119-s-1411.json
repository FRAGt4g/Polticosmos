    "summary": "The \u201cPreparing and Resourcing Our Student Parents and Early Childhood Teachers Act\u201d (PROSPECT Act) aims to establish federal grants to empower community colleges and minority-serving institutions. These grants support the development of infant and toddler child care, training, and access for student parents. The bill authorizes funding for planning, access, impact, and pipeline grants, focusing on expanding child care access, improving workforce pipelines, and providing financial aid information. It also amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program to increase federal matching payments and improve eligibility, as well as share information on dependent care allowances.",
