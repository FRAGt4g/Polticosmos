    "summary": "This bill, the Protecting Taxpayers from Student Loan Bailouts Act, aims to limit the Secretary of Education's authority to issue regulations and executive actions related to the Higher Education Act of 1965. It mandates the Secretary to assess the economic impact of proposed regulations, particularly focusing on potential increases in subsidy costs. If a regulation is deemed economically significant and would increase subsidy costs, the Secretary is prohibited from taking further action. This is in addition to other regulatory requirements, such as those included in Executive Orders.",
