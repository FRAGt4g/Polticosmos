    "summary": "The Employer Participation in Repayment Act aims to make permanent the exclusion from taxable income for employer-provided student loan repayment assistance. This would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by removing the expiration date for this exclusion, allowing employers to continue offering student loan repayment benefits without these payments being taxed as employee income. The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on March 3, 2025, and referred to the Committee on Ways and Means.",
