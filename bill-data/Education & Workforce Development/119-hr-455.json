    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 455, the \"Protecting Higher Education from Foreign Threats Act,\" proposes to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965. It would prohibit any institution of higher education from receiving federal funds or financial assistance if it knowingly employs an instructor who is also funded, directly or indirectly, by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The bill provides a path for institutions to regain eligibility for federal aid by demonstrating to the Secretary of Education that they no longer employ any \"CCP-funded instructors.\" The provisions are set to take effect 180 days after the bill's enactment.",
