    "summary": "The Appropriations Compliance and Training Act mandates annual appropriations law training for certain executive branch employees, particularly those in positions at or above GS-11, political positions, and Senior Executive Service positions. Agencies must either use a Government Accountability Office course or develop their own (with OMB and Comptroller General approval). The bill outlines required training topics, including the Antideficiency Act and the Impoundment Control Act. Non-compliance results in suspension and access restrictions. Agencies must report compliance and publish statistics. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will issue implementation guidance.",
