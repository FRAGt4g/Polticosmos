    "summary": "The Mental Health in Schools Excellence Program Act of 2025 aims to increase the number of school-based mental health service providers. It establishes a program where the Secretary of Education enters agreements with eligible graduate institutions to cover a portion of the cost of attendance for students in relevant programs (school psychology, counseling, social work, etc.). These contributions are matched by the institutions. The bill also defines key terms like 'eligible graduate institution' and 'school-based mental health field' and mandates outreach efforts from the Secretary.",
