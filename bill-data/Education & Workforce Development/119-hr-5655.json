    "summary": "The 'No Shame at School Act of 2025' amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. It mandates certification for student eligibility for free or reduced-price meals, streamlining the process. It also addresses the issue of unpaid meal debt, requiring retroactive reimbursement and prohibiting practices that stigmatize students with outstanding fees. This includes restricting overt identification, withholding educational opportunities, and using debt collectors, while also defining 'covered child' and 'unpaid school meal fees'. The bill aims to reduce the negative impact of unpaid meal fees on students.",
