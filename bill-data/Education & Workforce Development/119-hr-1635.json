    "summary": "The 'Pell to Grad Act' aims to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend Federal Pell Grant eligibility. Specifically, the bill allows students to use Pell Grants for postbaccalaureate studies under certain conditions, primarily if they received Pell Grants during their undergraduate studies. It also adjusts the duration limits for Pell Grant receipt. This legislation intends to make higher education more accessible by supporting graduate-level education for those who have previously benefited from Pell Grants.",
