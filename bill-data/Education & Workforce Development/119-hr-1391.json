    "summary": "The Student Veteran Benefit Restoration Act of 2025 aims to restore educational assistance benefits to student veterans defrauded by educational institutions. It mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to not charge educational assistance against a veteran's entitlement if the institution was not approved, in violation of regulations, found guilty of fraud, or closed due to fraud. The bill also requires institutions to repay the VA for restored benefits and outlines an appeals process. Furthermore, changes are made in Subchapter III of chapter 36, Title 38, United States Code.",
