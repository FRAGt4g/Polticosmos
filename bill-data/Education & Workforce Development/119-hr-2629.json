    "summary": "The \"Impact Aid Infrastructure Partnership Act\" aims to provide federal funding in partnership with local communities to improve school infrastructure for local educational agencies (LEAs) eligible for Impact Aid. The bill authorizes appropriations over four fiscal years, with funds allocated for competitive and formula grants. These grants prioritize LEAs with facilities in poor condition or lacking funds for construction, renovation, and repair. Funding priorities include addressing health hazards, safety standards, and technology deficiencies, with a focus on supporting LEAs on federal and tribal lands. Matching funds based on local economic conditions are also a component of this program.",
