    "summary": "The Wyoming Education Trust Modernization Act, introduced in the U.S. Senate on July 14, 2025, aims to amend the Act of July 10, 1890, concerning the disposal of public land in Wyoming for educational purposes. The bill modifies provisions related to financial aspects, specifically replacing instances of 'interest of' and 'income thereof' with 'earnings on' in sections 5, 7, and 8 of the original act. This suggests an update to how funds generated from public lands designated for education are managed.",
