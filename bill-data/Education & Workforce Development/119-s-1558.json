The bill requires the Secretary of Education to develop this form, including standardized terminology and clear presentation of costs, grants, scholarships, net price, loans, and aid acceptance processes. It also allows for supplemental information and consumer testing before finalization, aiming to improve transparency and student understanding of financial aid and college costs.",
