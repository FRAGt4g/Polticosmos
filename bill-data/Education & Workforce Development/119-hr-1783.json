    "summary": "The American Apprenticeship Act aims to assist states in funding pre-apprenticeship programs and related instruction for qualified apprenticeship programs registered under the National Apprenticeship Act. The bill defines key terms like \"qualified apprenticeship,\" \"pre-apprenticeship,\" and \"related instruction.\"  It authorizes the Secretary of Labor to award grants to states on a competitive basis, outlining application requirements, fund usage, and performance measures. The Secretary must also identify in-demand occupations lacking apprenticeship programs and report to Congress.  The bill authorizes $15 million in appropriations annually from 2026-2031.  A policy of non-supplanting of other funds is included.",
