    "summary": "The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2025 seeks to prevent harassment in higher education institutions. The bill mandates that institutions develop and disseminate comprehensive harassment policies, including prohibitions of harassment based on protected characteristics like sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity) and race. It also establishes a competitive grant program for institutions to implement or improve anti-harassment programs, including prevention, counseling, and education initiatives, with a focus on electronic communication and other technology. The bill authorizes appropriations for the grant program and clarifies that the Act does not supersede existing civil rights laws.",
