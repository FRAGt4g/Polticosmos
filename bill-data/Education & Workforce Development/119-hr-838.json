    "summary": "The Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success Act (A PLUS Act) allows states to submit a declaration of intent to the Secretary of Education to combine certain federal funds to improve student academic achievement. It aims to give states flexibility in implementing education reforms, reduce administrative costs, and ensure accountability. States can consolidate funds for programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, excluding those funded by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The bill outlines the required contents of the declaration, the review process by the Secretary, and provisions for transparency and equitable participation of private schools. It also sets limits on administrative expenses.",
