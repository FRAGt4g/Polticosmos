    "summary": "The 'A Chance To Serve Act' aims to expand benefits for Peace Corps and AmeriCorps volunteers. It provides non-competitive eligibility for federal jobs, addresses immigration status for Peace Corps volunteers, ensures regular stipend payments, extends healthcare benefits, and adjusts readjustment allowances for Peace Corps volunteers. For AmeriCorps, the bill increases national service positions, living allowances, and offers health benefits, while also modifying education awards. It also addresses federal loan repayment during service, creates tax exemptions for certain payments, and expands public service loan forgiveness.",
