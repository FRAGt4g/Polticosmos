    "summary": "The 'No More D.C. Waste Act' aims to prevent the District of Columbia from retaining unspent federal funds allocated for a tuition support program for D.C. residents. It mandates that any unobligated funds at the end of a fiscal year will lapse. The bill also amends the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999 to reflect this change. Furthermore, it requires the D.C. Chief Financial Officer to submit an annual report to Congress detailing the program's financial activity, including the number of payments, average assistance amount, and any remaining unobligated funds.",
