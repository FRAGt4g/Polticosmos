    "summary": "The Savings Opportunity and Affordable Repayment Act amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to create a new income-contingent repayment plan called the \"Savings Opportunity and Affordable Repayment plan\" (SOAR plan). This plan bases monthly payments on a borrower's income and family size, with the possibility of loan forgiveness after a certain period. The bill also modifies existing repayment plan options and sets conditions for eligibility, particularly regarding the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plans, and establishes new provisions on eligibility determination, including annual income verification and access to tax information.",
