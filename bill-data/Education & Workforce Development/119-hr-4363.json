    "summary": "The 'Defend Girls Athletics Act' aims to ensure \"biological fairness in women's sports\" at elementary, secondary schools, and institutions of higher education. It mandates that these institutions comply with Executive Order 14201 (relating to keeping men out of women's sports) as a condition of receiving federal funds. Schools must certify annual compliance, and non-compliance leads to fund return and ineligibility. Specific requirements and enforcement mechanisms are outlined for both schools and institutions of higher education, with penalties for non-compliance with the order.",
