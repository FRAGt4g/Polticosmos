    "summary": "The Ending Administrative Garnishment Act of 2025 aims to suspend and reform the Secretary of Education's authority to garnish wages for student loan debt. The bill mandates a suspension of wage garnishment until the Secretary certifies a process for addressing improper garnishments, including refunds, program suspension flexibility, and quarterly employer verification. If the Secretary implements the certification process, a centralized database tracking demographic data of garnished individuals must be established.  The bill also outlines employer liability for improper wage withholding, sets deadlines for action by the Secretary after improper garnishment, and places limits on the duration of outstanding loans subject to garnishment.",
