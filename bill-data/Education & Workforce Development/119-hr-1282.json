    "summary": "The Eliminate DEI in Colleges Act seeks to prohibit federal funding for institutions of higher education that engage in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The bill defines DEI as practices that classify individuals based on characteristics like race, sex, and sexual orientation, and potentially grant differential treatment. Institutions must certify they do not support DEI to receive federal funds, and the Secretary of Education will create regulations and handle appeals. The bill also specifies that institutions will make information available to verify the certification of non-involvement in DEI initiatives.",
