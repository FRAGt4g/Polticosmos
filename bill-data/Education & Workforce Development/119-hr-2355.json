    "summary": "This bill, the Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act of 2025, amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow charitable organizations to make grants for collegiate housing and infrastructure improvements. The grants can be used to provide, improve, operate, or maintain collegiate housing property, primarily for full-time students. It defines collegiate housing property and clarifies that grants to organizations holding title to property for the benefit of educational organizations are also permissible. The Act specifies the grants' permissible uses to the extent that it would be permissible for a dormitory or residential facility and excludes the use of a grant to provide physical fitness facilities. The amendment is effective for grants made in taxable years after the enactment of the Act.",
