    "summary": "The 'States\u2019 Education Reclamation Act of 2025' proposes to abolish the U.S. Department of Education, citing principles of federalism and local control. The bill would replace most federal education funding with block grants issued directly to states from FY 2025 through FY 2033, to be used for any education purpose permitted by state law. It includes provisions for audits, public reporting, and nondiscrimination. Key programs, such as Pell Grants, federal student loans, and special education grants, would not be eliminated but transferred to other federal agencies, including the Departments of the Treasury and Health and Human Services.",
