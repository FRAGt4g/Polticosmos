    "summary": "The Affordable College Textbook Act aims to reduce textbook costs for students by expanding the use of open educational resources (OER). It establishes a grant program for institutions of higher education to support projects that create, adapt, and promote the use of open textbooks. The bill also amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to improve textbook price information transparency, requiring institutions to disclose textbook costs and OER availability. It also mandates a GAO report on textbook costs and the impact of the Act.",
