    "summary": "The Safe Schools Improvement Act aims to address and prevent bullying and harassment in public elementary and secondary schools. It amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require states to establish anti-bullying policies, including prohibitions based on protected characteristics like race, sex, and disability. The bill mandates data collection, reporting, and evaluation of these policies. It also clarifies the relationship between the Act and existing federal and state laws, including those around free speech and expression.",
