    "summary": "Introduced by Rep. Biggs, the \"Defund National Endowment for the Humanities Act of 2025\" proposes to eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The bill would prohibit any funds made available to the NEH from being used to carry out its core functions as described in section 7 of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965. If enacted, the restriction would take effect on the first day of the first fiscal year after the bill is signed into law, effectively defunding the agency.",
