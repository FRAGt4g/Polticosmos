    "summary": "The Protecting Students with Disabilities Act (S. 2913) aims to prevent the Department of Education from restructuring offices that serve individuals with disabilities. It prohibits the use of appropriated funds for eliminating, consolidating, or altering such offices, their personnel's responsibilities, or delegating program administration outside the Department. The bill reaffirms Congress's intent to uphold existing statutes, primarily the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which mandate specific roles for the Office of Special Education Programs and the Rehabilitation Services Administration.",
