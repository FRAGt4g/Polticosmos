    "summary": "The Net Price Calculator Improvement Act aims to enhance the accuracy and usability of net price calculators for prospective college students. The bill mandates stricter requirements for these calculators, including clearer labeling, mandatory data display (including costs, aid, and the years the data applies), and a prohibition on selling user data. It also allows the Secretary of Education to develop a universal net price calculator, subject to consumer testing, and requires a report on raising awareness of net price calculators. The goal is to provide students with a better understanding of college costs.",
