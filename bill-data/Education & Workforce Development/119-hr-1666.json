    "summary": "The Pell Grant Sustainability Act aims to address the declining purchasing power of Federal Pell Grants. The bill proposes indexing the maximum grant value to inflation, starting in award year 2024-2025. It modifies the Higher Education Act of 1965 to calculate the maximum grant based on a base amount, adjusted annually by the Consumer Price Index, and the amount specified in the relevant appropriations act.  The goal is to ensure Pell Grants better cover the educational costs for lower-income students.",
