    "summary": "The PROTECT Jewish Student and Faculty Act (H.R. 406) proposes an amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965. To remain eligible for federal Title IV funding, institutions of higher education would be required to update all student and employee conduct documents. These documents must include a specific definition of antisemitism and a clear statement prohibiting antisemitic conduct on campus. The bill specifies that such conduct could lead to expulsion for students and employment termination for faculty and staff, defining antisemitism as hatred toward Jews directed at individuals, property, or community institutions.",
