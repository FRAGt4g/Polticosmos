This program will provide funds to local educational agencies for initiatives that offer voter registration information to 12th-grade students. To receive funds, agencies must apply to the EAC and consult with state and local election officials. Participating agencies must report on their program's effectiveness to the EAC, which will then submit a comprehensive report to Congress. The bill authorizes the appropriation of necessary funds.",
