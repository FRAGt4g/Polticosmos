    "summary": "This bill, the Law Enforcement Education Grant Program Act of 2025, proposes establishing a program to provide grants to students pursuing careers in law enforcement. The Secretary will award grants of $4,000 annually to selected candidates, with the total not exceeding $16,000.  Recipients must agree to serve as full-time law enforcement officers for at least 4 years within 8 years after finishing their studies. Failure to fulfill the service obligation will result in the grant being treated as a loan subject to repayment. The bill also specifies conditions for eligible institutions and defines key terms. Finally, it repeals the University Sustainability Programs.",
