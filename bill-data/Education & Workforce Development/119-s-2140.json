    "summary": "This bill, the Haskell Indian Nations University Improvement Act, proposes to establish Haskell Indian Nations University as a federally chartered corporation. This would grant the university greater autonomy through an independent board of trustees, aiming to improve its ability to provide high-quality, tuition-free education to Indian students. The bill outlines the structure of the Board, its powers, and the university's functions, including tuition-free education and degree programs. It addresses funding, tax status, and the transfer of functions from the legacy institution, ensuring compliance with other laws and establishing an endowment program.",
