    "summary": "The American Apprenticeship Act aims to assist states in funding pre-apprenticeship programs and related instruction. It defines key terms like \"qualified apprenticeship\" and \"pre-apprenticeship,\" outlining program requirements. The Secretary of Labor may award competitive grants to states, to defray costs of pre-apprenticeship programs and instruction associated with qualified apprenticeship programs. The bill also mandates reports to Congress on program effectiveness. The Secretary is directed to identify in-demand occupations lacking apprenticeships and analyze the use of the apprenticeship model. The bill authorizes appropriations of $15 million per year from 2026-2031.",
