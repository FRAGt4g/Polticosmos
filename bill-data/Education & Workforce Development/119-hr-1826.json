    "summary": "The Child Care Workforce Act proposes a pilot program to provide grants to states, Indian Tribes, and Tribal organizations to supplement the wages of eligible child care workers. The goal is to attract and retain workers, improve their well-being, enhance the quality of child care, and increase its affordability. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will administer the program, considering factors like the number of children and child care workers in a given area. Grantees must submit applications outlining their plans, including how the funds will be used, how impact will be measured, and how administrative costs will be managed. The Act also mandates an evaluation of the pilot program and a report to Congress.",
