    "summary": "The Military and Educational Data Integration Act mandates the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, to create a data-sharing process. This process will allow State educational agencies to access and integrate demographic data of Armed Forces members who graduated high school in that state, into their statewide or alternate data systems. The bill outlines the type of data to be shared, including education levels, school locations, Armed Forces Qualification Test scores, and other relevant information. It emphasizes data security, confidentiality, and protection of individual privacy.",
