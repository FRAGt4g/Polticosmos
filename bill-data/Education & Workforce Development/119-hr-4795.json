    "summary": "The Protect Economic and Academic Freedom Act of 2025 amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prohibit institutions of higher education from engaging in nonexpressive commercial boycotts of major strategic partners of the United States, including Israel. It mandates annual certifications from institutions to this effect, threatening ineligibility for certain federal funds. Furthermore, the bill requires institutions to certify they allow students and faculty to participate in academic programs in major strategic partners under the same terms as other foreign countries. The bill also expresses the sense of Congress that limitations on cooperative efforts with major strategic partners are detrimental to the United States.",
