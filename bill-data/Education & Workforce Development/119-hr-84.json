    "summary": "The \"Native American Education Opportunity Act\" aims to expand educational choices for Native American students. It authorizes Tribes to run Education Savings Account (ESA) programs, granting $8,000 per eligible student for private school tuition, tutoring, online learning, and other approved expenses. The bill also authorizes the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) to fund charter schools at BIE facilities. These programs target students attending or eligible for Bureau of Indian Education schools. The ESA program includes a five-year sunset provision and requires a Government Accountability Office study to review its implementation and impact.",
