    "summary": "This bill, known as Katie Meyer's Law, mandates that institutions of higher education provide students accused of violating the code of conduct with the option of an advisor. The bill requires these institutions to adopt a policy that allows students to choose an outside advisor or request an independent advisor from the institution. The bill details the requirements for these advisors, including training, bi-weekly updates with student permission, and participation in the adjudication process. Additionally, the bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to include the disclosure of incidents of suicide reported to campus security or local police.",
