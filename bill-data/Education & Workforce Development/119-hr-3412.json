    "summary": "This bill, the Ending Administrative Garnishment Act of 2025, aims to suspend and reform the Secretary of Education's authority to garnish wages for student loan debt. It mandates a suspension of wage garnishment until the Secretary certifies a process for refunding improperly garnished wages, allows the Secretary to cease garnishment, and requires quarterly verification of garnishment information.  The bill also establishes a database, requires reports, and defines liabilities for employers. It sets limits on garnishment based the age of the outstanding loan and specifies remedies for improper garnishment.",
