    "summary": "The Universal School Choice Act proposes amending the Internal Revenue Code to provide tax credits for individuals and corporations that donate to scholarship granting organizations. These organizations would provide scholarships for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses, including tuition, materials, and online resources. The bill defines eligible students, qualified expenses, and scholarship granting organizations, and sets volume caps and distribution requirements. It also includes provisions prohibiting government control over these organizations and non-public schools, along with parental rights regarding scholarship use.",
