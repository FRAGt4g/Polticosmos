    "summary": "The \"Ending Common Core and Expanding School Choice Act\" amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to establish a state-administered school choice program for low-income students. It redirects federal Title I funds to be allocated as a per-pupil amount that follows eligible children to their chosen school. These funds, managed according to state law, can be used for tuition and fees at public, charter, or accredited private schools, or for supplemental educational services. The bill also expressly prohibits the federal government from mandating academic standards like the Common Core, curricula, or assessments.",
