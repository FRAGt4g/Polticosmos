    "summary": "The Student Loan Bankruptcy Improvement Act of 2025 aims to make it easier for student loan borrowers to discharge their debt through bankruptcy. It proposes amending Section 523(a)(8) of title 11 of the United States Code by removing the term \"undue\" from the discharge standard. The bill cites several findings, emphasizing the difficulty and low success rate of current discharge standards, and argues for a more equitable approach to help borrowers and facilitate repayment. The amendment proposed should be applicable to current and future cases.",
