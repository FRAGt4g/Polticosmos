    "summary": "The 'Focus on Learning Act' directs the Surgeon General to study the impact of mobile device use in elementary and secondary schools, specifically examining its effects on student learning, outcomes, mental health, classroom instruction, and school climate. The bill also establishes a pilot program where grants are awarded to local educational agencies to help schools create mobile-device-free environments by purchasing secure containers and installing lockers. The pilot program includes exemptions for health conditions, students with disabilities, and English learners. Parents will be notified before and after grant applications and awards.",
