    "summary": "The Skills Investment Act of 2025 rebrands Coverdell education savings accounts into 'Coverdell lifelong learning accounts,' expanding their use for skills training and workforce development. It allows funds to cover career and technical education, certification programs, and related costs like technology for beneficiaries over 16. The bill modifies contribution rules, raising the eligibility age and increasing annual limits for those over 30. It also creates a 25% tax credit for employer contributions and an above-the-line deduction for beneficiary contributions, aiming to promote continuous learning and upskilling for American workers.",
