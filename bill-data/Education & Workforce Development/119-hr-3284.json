    "summary": "This bill, \"H.R. 3284\", aims to increase oversight of foreign gifts and contracts received by educational institutions. It mandates audits of at least 30 institutions every two years to assess compliance with existing reporting requirements under Section 117 of the Higher Education Act.  It also imposes excise taxes on institutions receiving contributions from foreign countries of concern and on institutions that fail to report foreign funding, with the tax for the latter being 110% of the unreported funds.  The bill specifies audit contents, reporting requirements to Congress, and effective dates.",
