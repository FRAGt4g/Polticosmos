    "summary": "The CLASS Act of 2025 aims to protect students in higher education. It prevents the enforcement of arbitration agreements in enrollment contracts between students and institutions of higher education. Furthermore, it prohibits institutions from limiting a student's ability to pursue legal claims against them in court. The act defines key terms like 'enrollment agreement' and 'institution of higher education' and stipulates that the changes will become effective one year after enactment.",
