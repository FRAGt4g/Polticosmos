    "summary": "The Apprenticeship Pathways Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Labor to award contracts to industry intermediaries. These intermediaries will promote and facilitate the development of and access to apprenticeships, particularly for secondary school students. The bill outlines eligibility criteria for intermediaries, prioritizes contracts targeting underserved populations (including those in high-poverty areas, disconnected youth, and students with disabilities), and specifies allowable uses of funds for pre-apprenticeship programs, training, support services, and even partial wage coverage. The bill lists specific high-need occupations, including those in construction, healthcare, technology, and manufacturing and authorizes appropriations to carry out the act.",
