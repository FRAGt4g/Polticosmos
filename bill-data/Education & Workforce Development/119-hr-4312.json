    "summary": "The Student Compensation and Opportunity through Rights and Endorsements Act (SCORE Act) aims to protect student athletes' name, image, and likeness (NIL) rights, promoting fair competition in intercollegiate athletics. It allows student athletes to enter NIL agreements, with exceptions for prohibited compensation or violations of institutional codes. The bill specifies definitions for key terms like 'agent', 'associated entity', and 'college sports revenue'. It also amends the Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act, provides requirements for certain institutions, and outlines roles for interstate intercollegiate athletic associations. The Act includes provisions for transparency of student athletic fees and preempts state laws that conflict with its provisions.",
