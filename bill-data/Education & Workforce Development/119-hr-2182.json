    "summary": "The Pre-Pilot Pathway Act aims to address pilot shortages by establishing an apprenticeship program for students at flight training providers. The Secretary of Transportation will create the program, in consultation with industry stakeholders, under which flight training providers can select apprentices. The bill outlines curriculum requirements based on existing regulations, allows providers to impose additional requirements, and incentivizes retired pilots to become instructors. It mandates annual reports to Congress on apprentice progress and program effectiveness, including methods to assist retired pilots in gaining instructor qualifications. ",
