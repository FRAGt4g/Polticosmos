    "summary": "The 'Cutting Red Tape on Child Care Providers Act of 2025' aims to remove regulatory barriers faced by licensed child care providers that prevent them from preparing simple foods like fruits and vegetables. The bill amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to prohibit states from creating such restrictions. It argues these regulations hinder providers, especially home-based centers, and limit children's access to nutritious food. The bill also highlights the decline of home-based child care options and the disproportionate impact this has on low-income and rural families.",
