    "summary": "This bill amends the Federal TRIO programs, which support disadvantaged students. It increases minimum grant amounts and authorizes $1.1 billion for FY2025. The legislation refines the grant award process by emphasizing \"prior success\" over \"experience,\" allowing applicants to correct technical errors, and creating an appeals system for scoring. It expands the definition of a \"low-income individual\" to include Pell Grant eligibility, updates program outcome metrics, increases student stipends for certain programs (including for veterans), and mandates the Department of Education to provide virtual technical assistance for grant applicants.",
