    "summary": "The Expanding Access to High-Impact Tutoring Act of 2025 aims to improve student academic achievement by awarding grants to state educational agencies (SEAs) for tutoring programs in elementary and secondary schools. The bill authorizes funding for grants to SEAs, coordination of a nationwide tutoring workforce, program evaluation, and an advisory board. Subgrants will be awarded to local educational agencies (LEAs), prioritizing those with high needs and requiring detailed plans. Programs must meet specific requirements, including tutoring frequency, tutor qualifications, training, and evaluations. The bill emphasizes collaboration with educator unions and incorporates provisions for program renewal and workforce development, especially for schools with teacher shortages.",
