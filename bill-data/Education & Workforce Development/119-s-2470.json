    "summary": "The College Athlete Economic Freedom Act aims to grant college athletes the right to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL).  It prohibits institutions and associations from restricting or interfering with athletes' ability to market their NIL, including forming collective representation and negotiating contracts. The bill defines key terms, addresses international student-athletes, and provides for grants to analyze the NIL monetization market. It also includes enforcement provisions, a private right of action, and specifies state preemption, with an exception for athlete agent certification. Finally, it addresses visa and employment authorization for international college athletes.",
