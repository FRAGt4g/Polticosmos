    "summary": "The 'One School, One Nurse Act of 2025' proposes a competitive grant program administered by the Secretary of Education for local and state educational agencies. The goal is to ensure every elementary and secondary school has at least one full-time registered nurse. Funds can be used to recruit, hire, and retain nurses, including by increasing salaries and converting part-time roles to full-time. The bill prioritizes high-need school districts and aims to improve health outcomes, attendance, and healthcare access for students, particularly those who are uninsured or have chronic health conditions.",
