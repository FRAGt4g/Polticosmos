    "summary": "This bill, the Salad Bars in Schools Expansion Act, aims to increase the use of salad bars in schools to promote healthier eating habits among children. It amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act by directing the Secretary to create a plan to promote salad bars, provide training and technical assistance, and establish a grant program to help schools install them. The bill also requires a report on the program's effectiveness and revisions to existing guidance. The bill specifies the eligibility for the grant, the program termination, and definition of durable equipment that schools can purchase.",
