    "summary": "The 'American Students First Act' aims to restrict federal financial assistance to public higher education institutions. It prohibits institutions from offering in-state tuition rates or state-based financial aid to undocumented immigrants. The bill amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to enforce this prohibition, impacting eligibility for federal funding based on the institution's practices regarding undocumented students.",
