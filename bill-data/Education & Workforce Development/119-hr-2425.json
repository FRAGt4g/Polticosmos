    "summary": "The Kairo Act of 2025 aims to enhance transparency and safety in childcare settings receiving federal funding. It mandates that childcare providers develop a parent's bill of rights, outlining access to information regarding facility records, inspection reports, staff training, and video recordings of incidents. It also addresses parental access to information about Head Start programs. The bill requires providers to inform parents of these rights within a specified timeframe and directs the Department of Health and Human Services to notify funding recipients of the new requirements.",
