    "summary": "The Tax-Free Pell Grant Act aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt Pell Grants from gross income, expanding the existing tax exclusion for scholarships and fellowships. The bill modifies Section 117(b)(1) to include Pell Grants and also adjusts provisions related to the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits, ensuring Pell Grants are treated differently in these contexts. The amendments are slated to take effect for taxable years starting after December 31, 2025.",
