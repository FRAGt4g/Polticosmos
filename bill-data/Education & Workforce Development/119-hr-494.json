    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 494, seeks to amend the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 to strengthen the Federal Cyber Scholarship for Service Program. It proposes two key changes: first, extending a program-related time period from three to five years. Second, it aims to enhance the student loan repayment benefits for participants by ensuring the full loan amount is covered, regardless of other limitations under the Higher Education Act. The goal is to improve the pipeline of cybersecurity professionals entering government service by making the scholarship program more attractive and effective.",
