    "summary": "The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025 amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to allow schools to serve whole milk. It mandates schools offer a variety of fluid milk, including organic or non-organic whole, reduced-fat, low-fat, and fat-free options, and lactose-free milk. The bill also specifies that milk fat in whole milk is not considered saturated fat for meal compliance and prohibits schools from purchasing milk from Chinese state-owned enterprises. Schools can't be prohibited from offering whole milk.",
