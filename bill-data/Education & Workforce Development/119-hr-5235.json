    "summary": "This bill, the Skills-Based Federal Contracting Act, aims to remove unnecessary educational requirements for contractor personnel in federal contract solicitations. It amends Title 41 of the United States Code to prohibit minimum education requirements unless a written justification explains why the requirement is necessary. The bill also mandates OMB guidance for implementation and a GAO report to evaluate compliance. It defines 'education' and 'education requirement' and repeals a related section from a previous National Defense Authorization Act.",
