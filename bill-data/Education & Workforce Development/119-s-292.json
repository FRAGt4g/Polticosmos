    "summary": "The bill, the Educational Choice for Children Act of 2025, proposes tax credits for charitable donations to organizations providing scholarships for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses. It defines eligible students, qualified expenses, and scholarship granting organizations, setting requirements for the latter.  It also establishes a volume cap for the credit and addresses organizational and parental autonomy, preventing government control over scholarship organizations and private schools. Finally, Scholarships for Qualified Elementary or Secondary Education Expenses of Eligible Students would be exempt from gross income.",
