    "summary": "This bill, the Building Lasting Opportunities for Community K\u201312 Act (BLOCK Act), aims to consolidate federal education funding. It proposes repealing several formula grants under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, starting October 1, 2025. These funds would then be reallocated as block grants to individual states, with amounts based on their 2025 funding levels, unless otherwise modified by Congress. This shift focuses on state-level control over educational resources.",
