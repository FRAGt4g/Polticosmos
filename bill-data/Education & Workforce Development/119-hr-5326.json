    "summary": "The Firefighter Learning And Management Education Act (FLAME Act) amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974. It grants the Administrator of the U.S. Fire Administration the authority to cancel or delay courses at the National Academy for Fire Prevention and Control.  It mandates Congressional notification for large-scale cancellations and requires reimbursement of certain expenses for fire departments impacted by cancellations. The bill also calls for a GAO study to assess the impact of course cancellations on fire department preparedness and the Academy's role in emergency response and training.",
