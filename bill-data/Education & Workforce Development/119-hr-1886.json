    "summary": "The Affordable College Textbook Act aims to reduce textbook costs for students by expanding the use of open educational resources (OER). It authorizes grants for institutions of higher education to support projects that promote OER adoption, create or adapt open textbooks, and assess their impact.  The bill also amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to update definitions of OER and require institutions to provide more information about textbook costs and digital textbook terms. It includes provisions for accessibility and requires reports on the initiative's effectiveness.",
