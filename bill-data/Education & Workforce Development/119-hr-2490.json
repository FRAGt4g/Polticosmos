    "summary": "This bill, the \"No In-State Tuition for Illegal Immigrants Act,\" aims to prevent states from offering in-state tuition rates to undocumented immigrants if they wish to receive federal financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. It amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, defining an \"ineligible State\" as one that offers such tuition rates. The Secretary of Education would determine a state's eligibility and states that violate this rule would lose access to federal funds.",
