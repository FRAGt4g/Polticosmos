    "summary": "The College Transparency Act mandates the creation of a secure, privacy-protected national postsecondary student data system. This system aims to evaluate student outcomes, improve transparency, and aid student decision-making while reducing reporting burdens on higher education institutions. It requires the Commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics to develop and maintain the system, including defining data elements, establishing an advisory committee, and conducting periodic data matches with other federal agencies to gather data on enrollment, outcomes, and finances. The bill also repeals a prohibition on such a system and amends existing law to require data submission from participating institutions.",
