    "summary": "The 'Fairness in Higher Education Accreditation Act' modifies criteria for accrediting agencies for higher education institutions. It prohibits agencies from considering race, sex, or national origin in areas like student body composition and leadership roles, and requires agencies to allow institutions to adopt any lawful policy regarding these factors. Additionally, the bill outlines free inquiry definitions and provides religious exemptions. Finally, the bill allows institutions to pursue civil action if accreditation is impacted by an agency violating these new stipulations.",
