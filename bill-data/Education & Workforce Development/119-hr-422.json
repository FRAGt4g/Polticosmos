    "summary": "The \"No Subsidies for Wealthy Universities Act\" proposes to limit federal reimbursement for indirect costs associated with research awards at institutions of higher education. It establishes a tiered system based on endowment size: institutions with over $5 billion are prohibited from using federal funds for indirect costs, those with endowments between $2 billion and $5 billion are capped at an 8% indirect cost rate, and all other institutions are capped at 15%. The bill also mandates that the Comptroller General submit an annual report to Congress on how these indirect cost reimbursements are used by universities.",
