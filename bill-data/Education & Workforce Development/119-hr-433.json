    "summary": "The 'Department of Education Protection Act' (H.R. 433) prohibits the Department of Education from using funds from previous appropriations acts for any reorganization. This includes decentralizing, reducing staffing, or altering the department's responsibilities, structure, or authority as it existed on January 1, 2025. Citing Congress's authority to structure federal agencies, the bill aims to preserve key offices like Federal Student Aid and the Office for Civil Rights. The act is intended to prevent unilateral executive branch changes to the department, ensuring its continued mission to promote student achievement and equal access to education.",
