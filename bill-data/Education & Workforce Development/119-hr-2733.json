    "summary": "The Pell Grant Flexibility Act amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide Pell Grant flexibility for students with disabilities. Specifically, it allows students with disabilities who are approved for reduced course loads to be considered full-time students for Pell Grant calculation purposes, ensuring they receive the appropriate financial aid. This applies to enrollment in a reduced course load or 5 credits (or the equivalent), whichever is greater, and is separate from semester eligibility calculations.",
