    "summary": "The 'Restore College Sports Act' aims to establish the American Collegiate Sports Association (ACSA) to replace the NCAA. The ACSA would oversee and regulate college sports with a commissioner appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Key provisions include equal distribution of NIL revenue among student-athletes, unrestricted transfer rights, conference realignment based on time zones, equal revenue sharing among institutions and athletes, coaching salary caps, and equal distribution of broadcasting revenue. Compliance with ACSA rules is tied to federal funding through amendments to the Higher Education Act.",
