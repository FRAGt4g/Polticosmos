    "summary": "The 'Educational Choice for Children Act of 2025' amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide tax credits for individuals and corporations donating to scholarship granting organizations that provide scholarships for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses. It defines eligible students (based on income) and qualified expenses (tuition, materials, tutoring, etc.). The bill sets a volume cap for the tax credit, establishes requirements for scholarship granting organizations, and includes provisions to prevent government control over these organizations and participating schools. It also addresses issues of parental rights and intervention in legal challenges to the Act's provisions.",
