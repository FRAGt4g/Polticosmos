    "summary": "The 'Building Youth Workforce Skills Act' aims to amend the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. It proposes allowing local areas to use individual training accounts to fund workforce training for in-school youth (ages 16-21) and out-of-school youth. These funds will be used to pay eligible training providers, similar to how individual training accounts are currently used for adult and dislocated workers. The bill's intent is to increase opportunities for youth workforce development.",
