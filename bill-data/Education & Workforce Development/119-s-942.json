It proposes interest-free deferment on student loans for individuals serving in medical or dental internship or residency programs. The bill specifically focuses on modifying section 455(f) of the Higher Education Act to allow for this deferment, ensuring that borrowers in these programs do not accrue interest on their student loans during their residency.",
