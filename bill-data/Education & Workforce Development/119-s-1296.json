It strengthens disclosure requirements for foreign gifts and contracts received by higher education institutions, particularly focusing on those from countries or entities of concern. The bill prohibits contracts with such foreign entities and outlines waiver procedures. It also mandates institutional policies regarding foreign gifts and contracts, including a searchable database of disclosures and requirements for compliance officers, and sets enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance and interagency information sharing.",
