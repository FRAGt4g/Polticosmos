    "summary": "The STEM RESTART Act (H.R. 4452) amends the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to create a national program that supports mid-career workers re-entering the STEM workforce. It authorizes the Department of Labor to award grants to small and medium-sized STEM businesses. These businesses can use the grants to offer paid internships or \"returnships,\" providing training and education for unemployed or underemployed individuals. The goal is to facilitate their transition or return to STEM-related jobs at positions above entry level. Grants range from $100,000 to $5,000,000 depending on the size of the enterprise.",
