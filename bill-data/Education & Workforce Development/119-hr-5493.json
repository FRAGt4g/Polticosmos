    "summary": "The USA Workforce Investment Act proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a tax credit for charitable donations to organizations providing workforce development or apprenticeship training programs. The credit is available to individuals for qualified cash contributions, capped at $1,700, and is reduced by any state tax credit received. The bill defines qualified contributions, workforce development organizations, and programs, clarifies that the donations cannot be claimed as charitable contributions under section 170, and outlines carryforward provisions for unused credit. It aims at encouraging investment in workforce training.",
