    "summary": "The EDUCATE Act aims to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prohibit graduate medical schools from receiving federal financial assistance if they adopt certain diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. It requires schools to certify they won't compel adherence to specific DEI tenets, discriminate based on race/ethnicity, or maintain DEI offices. The bill also affects accrediting agencies and includes rules of construction to protect First Amendment rights and religious institutions. It is a response to concerns about DEI policies in academia.",
