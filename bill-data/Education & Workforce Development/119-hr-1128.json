    "summary": "The Endowment Accountability Act (H.R. 1128) proposes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Primarily, it aims to increase the excise tax rate on investment income of private colleges and universities from 1.4% to 10%. It also seeks to broaden the definition of an \"applicable educational institution\" for this tax by lowering the threshold for aggregate fair market value per student from $500,000 to $200,000. These changes would apply to taxable years beginning after the Act's enactment.",
