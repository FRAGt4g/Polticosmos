    "summary": "This bill, the Mathematical and Statistical Modeling Education Act, focuses on modernizing mathematics education in STEM fields. It aims to improve mathematical and statistical modeling education through incorporating data-driven, computational thinking, and project-based learning. The bill authorizes the National Science Foundation to award grants for research and development to institutions of higher education and non-profit organizations to support these goals. It also mandates a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) study to identify best practices and recommend improvements for mathematical modeling in K-12 education. Funding is allocated for the program through 2030, with a sunset provision in 2029.",
