    "summary": "The School Lunch Debt Cancellation Act of 2025 mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to eliminate existing school meal debt owed by households and subsequently pay the owed amount to local educational authorities using the Commodity Credit Corporation funds. It also expands the CCC's authority to be used for nutrition assistance programs and related emergency food programs. The bill amends existing legislation regarding food programs to incorporate these changes, including extending funding for commodity supplemental food programs and enabling the use of CCC funds.",
