    "summary": "The 'No Cuts to Public Schools Act' aims to prevent reductions in funding for critical education programs. It defines these programs, primarily from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and mandates that for fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027, an amount equal to any funding reduction, as compared to FY2024 levels, is appropriated from the Treasury. The bill also specifies that the budgetary effects won't be calculated on PAYGO scorecards and has availability provisions and definitions regarding appropriations.",
