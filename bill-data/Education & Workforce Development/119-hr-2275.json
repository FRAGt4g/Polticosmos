    "summary": "This bill, the 'Support Children Having Open Opportunities for Learning Act of 2025' or the SCHOOL Act of 2025, aims to allow federal education funding to follow students to their chosen learning environment, including public, private, and home schools. It amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to allocate funds based on student enrollment, providing funds to local educational agencies and eligible children via education savings accounts. The bill lists allowable uses of funds and emphasizes non-supplanting of existing funds and a lack of federal control over non-public education. The intent is to equalize funding and expand educational opportunities.",
