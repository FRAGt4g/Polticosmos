    "summary": "The Supporting Apprenticeship Colleges Act of 2025 aims to authorize funding for institutions of higher education that sponsor construction and manufacturing-oriented registered apprenticeship programs. It establishes two grant programs: a community outreach grant program to support student and employer engagement, and a student support grant program to enhance advising and support services for enrolled students. The bill defines key terms like \"eligible entity\" (a construction and manufacturing-oriented apprenticeship college) and outlines reporting requirements for grant recipients.",
