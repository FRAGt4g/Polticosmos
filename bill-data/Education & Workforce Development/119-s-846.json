    "summary": "The Child Care Workforce Act establishes a pilot program to provide grants to states, tribes, and tribal organizations to supplement the wages of eligible child care workers. The goal is to increase the supply and quality of child care services by attracting and retaining workers, improving their well-being, and increasing the availability of affordable care. The bill defines key terms, outlines eligibility requirements, specifies how funds can be used, mandates an evaluation of the program, and requires a report to Congress. It authorizes necessary appropriations and sets an effective date.",
