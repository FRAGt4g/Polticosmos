    "summary": "The Preparing And Retaining All (PARA) Educators Act aims to address the recruitment and retention of paraprofessionals in public elementary, secondary schools, and preschool programs. It authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to state educational agencies, which then make subgrants to eligible entities (like local educational agencies and educational service agencies). These funds can be used for various activities including paraprofessional leader induction, professional development, certifications, and increased wages. The bill prioritizes entities serving low-income families and requires annual reporting on wage baselines and program impact. The act authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2026-2030.",
