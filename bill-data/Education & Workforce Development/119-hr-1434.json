    "summary": "The 'Strengthening Communities through Summer Employment Act' aims to provide funding to summer youth employment programs.  It authorizes appropriations for the Secretary of Labor to award grants to eligible entities. These grants will support the expansion and implementation of programs designed to improve academic, economic, and criminal justice outcomes for youth, including those in underserved areas. The bill outlines program requirements, prioritizes entities with high youth unemployment and crime rates, and mandates program evaluation. It also establishes an Advisory Board within the Department of Labor to assist in application review, technical assistance, and impact evaluation.",
