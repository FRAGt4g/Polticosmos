    "summary": "The Transition-to-Success Mentoring Act aims to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide grants to entities for school-based mentoring programs. These programs will assist at-risk middle school students with their transition to high school. The grants will fund success coaches who create plans with students, offer guidance, and connect them with resources. The bill prioritizes programs serving students in high-need areas and emphasizes postsecondary preparation and career development. The bill outlines requirements for grant applications, uses of funds, grant duration, reporting, and definitions of key terms.",
