    "summary": "This bill, the SBIR/STTR Innovation Workforce Act, amends the Small Business Act to allow federal agencies to provide grants or awards to small businesses that have received Phase II SBIR or STTR awards. These funds are to facilitate fellowship and internship opportunities for students at various academic levels (undergraduate to postdoctoral) in fields relevant to the agency. The bill mandates enhanced outreach to increase participation from women, socially disadvantaged, and economically disadvantaged individuals. It also allows agencies to partner with or fund third-party organizations to support outreach, with funding limitations. The bill introduces similar provisions within different sections of the Small Business Act.",
