    "summary": "The 'Dismantling Ideological Policies for Semiconductors and Science Act' aims to repeal or modify provisions of the CHIPS Act of 2022 and the Research and Development, Competition, and Innovation Act. The bill's core focus is to eliminate or reduce diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requirements within STEM-related programs and federal funding. It targets programs related to educational outreach, research capacity, and workforce development, while also seeking to limit federal mandates on entities seeking federal funds, particularly those related to hiring practices and community investments.",
