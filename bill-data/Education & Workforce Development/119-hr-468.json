    "summary": "Mel's Law (H.R. 468) proposes amending the Higher Education Act of 1965. It would mandate that colleges and universities participating in federal student aid programs establish a policy to award posthumous degrees. To be eligible, a deceased student must have been enrolled and in good academic standing at their time of death. The bill also prohibits accrediting bodies from penalizing institutions for the number of such degrees awarded. The law would take effect one year after enactment, providing institutions time to develop and implement the required policy.",
