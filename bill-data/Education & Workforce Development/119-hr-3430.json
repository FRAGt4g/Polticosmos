    "summary": "The School Resource Officer Funding Protection Act of 2025 mandates that states maintain a certain level of funding for school resource officer (SRO) programs in elementary and secondary schools. States receiving federal education funds must either maintain their SRO funding at the level of the previous year or the average of the five preceding years, unless a waiver is granted due to extraordinary financial circumstances. The bill requires annual reporting on SRO funding and outlines penalties for non-compliance, including reduced federal funding. The bill defines an SRO according to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.",
