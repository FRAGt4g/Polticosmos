    "summary": "The College Athlete Economic Freedom Act aims to grant college athletes the right to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL). It prohibits institutions and athletic associations from restricting this right and allows athletes to form collective representatives. The bill defines various terms, provides for equitable institutional support, addresses international athlete eligibility and employment, and includes enforcement provisions with FTC oversight and a private right of action. It also includes grant programs for market analysis and preempts state laws that conflict with its provisions.",
