    "summary": "This bill, the Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act of 2025, mandates that states receiving federal funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 establish minimum requirements for concussion prevention and treatment in school sports. These requirements include local educational agencies developing concussion safety plans, posting concussion information, immediate removal of students suspected of having a concussion from school-sponsored athletic activities, a written release from healthcare professionals for return to play, and academic accommodations for students recovering from concussions. Non-compliance by states leads to a reduction in federal funding.",
