The bill authorizes the National Science Foundation to award grants for programs like online workshops, mentoring, internships, and outreach, designed to promote STEM education and employment. It highlights disparities in STEM representation and retention across various demographics, and authorizes $15 million annually for program funding from 2026-2030.",
