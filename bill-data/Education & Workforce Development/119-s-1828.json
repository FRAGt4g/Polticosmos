    "summary": "The Safe Routes Improvement Act amends title 23 of the United States Code to mandate that each state designate a coordinator for its safe routes to school program. This coordinator will serve as the primary point of contact for the program within the state. The bill outlines the coordinator's duties, specifies the use of existing staff, requires contact information to be provided online, sets a deadline for filling vacancies, and allows for the use of existing funds for the coordinator's salary. It also includes a conforming amendment to a related section.",
