    "summary": "This bill, HR 3518, amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prohibit graduate medical schools from receiving federal financial assistance if they adopt certain diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. It would restrict schools from compelling faculty, staff, or students to express DEI tenets, implementing policies that disadvantage students based on race, and establishing DEI offices. The bill includes exceptions for instruction on unique medical needs related to demographics and maintains First Amendment rights while providing specific accreditation guidelines.",
