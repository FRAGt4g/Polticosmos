    "summary": "The 'Supporting Apprenticeship Colleges Act of 2025' aims to bolster construction and manufacturing-oriented registered apprenticeship programs offered by institutions of higher education. The bill authorizes funding for two grant programs: one for community outreach to attract students and employers, and another for student support services such as academic advising and mental health counseling. Grants are awarded to eligible entities, defined as construction and manufacturing-oriented apprenticeship colleges. The bill prioritizes outreach to underrepresented populations and authorizes funding for fiscal years 2026-2030.",
