    "summary": "The School Guardian Act of 2025 proposes to provide block grants to states for assigning armed law enforcement officers to elementary and secondary schools (K-12). It amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, defining terms like \"K-12 school\" and \"local educational agency.\" The Attorney General will award grants based on a state's K-12 student population. States administer the grants, which can fund officer pay, training, and equipment. Local law enforcement agencies can receive subgrants, requiring agreements with schools. The bill mandates reporting requirements and addresses the handling of unused funds, with funding coming from unobligated balances provided to the Internal Revenue Service via Public Law 117-169.",
