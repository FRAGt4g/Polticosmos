The bill authorizes grants to states to award subgrants to local educational agencies. These subgrants will fund training for school personnel on seizure awareness, preparedness, and medication administration.  It also mandates individualized health care plans and emergency plans, and outlines specific requirements for school personnel, school nurses, and school bus drivers concerning seizure management and student well-being, while ensuring no liability for good faith actions. The bill also authorizes $34,500,000 in appropriations for the period of fiscal years 2026-2030.",
