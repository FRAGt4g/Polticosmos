    "summary": "The World Language Education Assistance Program Act (H.R. 1572) aims to address a perceived crisis in America's language capacity. It directs the Secretary of Education to award grants to local educational agencies to establish or improve world language or dual language programs, with a focus on proficiency for students, professional development for teachers, and partnerships with community-based programs. The bill defines key terms like \"dual language program\" and \"heritage learner,\" outlines application criteria, including priority for programs incorporating specific initiatives, and specifies reporting requirements for grant recipients. It authorizes $15 million annually for this initiative.",
