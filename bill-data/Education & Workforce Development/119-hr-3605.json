    "summary": "The Strength in Diversity Act of 2025 aims to address racial and socioeconomic isolation in schools. It authorizes the Secretary to award grants to eligible entities (SEAs, LEAs, etc.) for developing and implementing plans to increase diversity in covered schools (publicly-funded early childhood programs, elementary, and secondary schools). The grants can be for planning or implementation and prioritize programs addressing racial isolation or those extending beyond a single LEA. Applications require detailed plans, community engagement, and performance measures focusing on student outcomes and diversity. The bill also defines several terms, including 'covered school' and 'eligible entity.'",
