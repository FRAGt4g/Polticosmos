    "summary": "This bill, the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Latino Act, aims to permit the museum's location within the National Mall Reserve. It amends previous legislation to clarify site selection processes, particularly when a site is under the jurisdiction of another federal agency. The bill also mandates that the museum's exhibits and programs accurately and comprehensively represent the diversity of Hispanic and Latino cultures and viewpoints.  It requires regular reports to Congress on the museum's compliance with these requirements.",
