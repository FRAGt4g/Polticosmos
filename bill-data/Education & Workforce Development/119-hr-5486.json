    "summary": "The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2025 aims to prevent harassment in higher education institutions. It requires institutions to develop and distribute anti-harassment policies, including prohibitions of harassment based on various protected characteristics, and outlines procedures for reporting and addressing incidents. The bill also establishes a competitive grant program for eligible entities (institutions and consortia) to fund programs aimed at preventing harassment and providing support to affected students. The act will also include the creation of a best practices report. It authorizes appropriations of $50 million annually from 2026-2031 for this purpose",
