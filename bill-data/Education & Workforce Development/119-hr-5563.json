    "summary": "The DRIVE-SAFE Act (H.R. 5563) establishes a voluntary apprenticeship program for commercial drivers under 21 years of age, allowing them to drive commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce under specific conditions. The program involves two probationary periods with varying driving time and performance benchmarks.  The bill outlines vehicle technology requirements, mandates an experienced driver accompany apprentices, and requires record-keeping and remediation for incidents. The Secretary of Transportation is tasked with creating regulations within a year of the bill's enactment. The bill also specifies employer responsibilities and does not exempt apprentices from commercial driver's license requirements.",
