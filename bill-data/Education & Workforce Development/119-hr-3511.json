    "summary": "The 'Preparing for the Future Act' amends the Public Health Service Act to establish a grant program for undergraduate and graduate students pursuing school psychology. The grants, up to $8,000 annually (with a maximum of $16,000), are provided to students who agree to work as school psychologists in covered schools (schools with a low school psychologist-to-student ratio) for at least four years within eight years after completing their program. The bill outlines application processes, eligibility requirements including GPA and educational plans to obtain necessary credentials, agreements for service, repayment terms if the service obligation is not met, and definitions of key terms. The Assistant Secretary is required to prepare and submit a report on the program every two years.",
