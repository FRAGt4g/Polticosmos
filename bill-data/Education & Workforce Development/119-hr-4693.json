    "summary": "The College Athlete Right to Organize Act aims to grant collective bargaining rights to college athletes. The bill amends the National Labor Relations Act to define college athletes who receive compensation (including grant-in-aid) as employees, thereby allowing them to form unions and negotiate with their institutions. It also addresses multiemployer bargaining units for conferences, clarifies NLRB jurisdiction, and includes provisions regarding the tax implications of compensation and federal financial assistance. The Act seeks to address unfair labor practices faced by college athletes by giving them the same rights as professional athletes.",
