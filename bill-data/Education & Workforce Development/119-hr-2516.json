    "summary": "The Accreditation for College Excellence Act of 2025 aims to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965. It prohibits institutions of higher education from being subjected to political litmus tests during the accreditation process, ensuring that accreditation standards do not require or coerce institutions to adopt specific political or ideological viewpoints. It also limits the Secretary of Education's ability to establish criteria for accreditation agencies.",
