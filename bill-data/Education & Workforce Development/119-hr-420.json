    "summary": "The Federal Grant Accountability Act aims to limit the indirect costs that institutions of higher education can claim on federal research grants. It proposes capping these costs at the average rate used for private research awards, with the Office of Management and Budget determining this average annually. The bill also directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study comparing federal and private indirect cost rates, examining how funds are used for administrative staff, and recommending improvements to enhance transparency and consistency in the system for federal research awards.",
