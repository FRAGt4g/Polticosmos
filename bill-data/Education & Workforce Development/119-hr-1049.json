    "summary": "This bill, the Transparency in Reporting of Adversarial Contributions to Education Act, aims to increase transparency regarding foreign influence in public schools. It mandates that local educational agencies provide parents with information on curricular materials, personnel compensation, donations, agreements, and financial transactions involving foreign countries or entities of concern. Schools must also post a summary of these parental rights on their websites or disseminate them publicly. The Secretary will notify state educational agencies, who in turn will notify local agencies. This aims to empower parents with knowledge about foreign influences in their children's education.",
