    "summary": "The Mentoring to Succeed Act of 2025 establishes a competitive grant program to support youth mentoring programs. The bill amends the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to provide funds for eligible entities, such as community-based organizations and covered partnerships, to establish, expand, or enhance mentoring programs. These programs aim to support eligible youth in developing cognitive and social-emotional skills, prepare them for academic and workforce success, and provide resources for mentors, including training and background checks. The bill also mandates a study on the effectiveness of mentoring programs and the grant program itself.",
