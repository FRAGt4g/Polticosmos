    "summary": "The Focus on Learning Act aims to assess the impact of mobile device use in elementary and secondary schools. It directs the Surgeon General to conduct a study on the effects of mobile devices on student learning, mental health, and school climate. Additionally, the bill establishes a pilot program where grants are awarded to local educational agencies to create mobile device-free school environments. The program involves the purchase of secure containers and lockers for device storage and includes exemptions for health, disability, and language learning needs, while requiring parental notification and feedback.",
