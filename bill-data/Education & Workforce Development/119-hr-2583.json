    "summary": "This bill, the College Admissions Accountability Act of 2025, establishes an Office of the Special Inspector General for Unlawful Discrimination in Higher Education within the Department of Education. The Inspector General will investigate allegations of discriminatory admissions practices, policies, and programs, focusing on violations of the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The office will also review federal policies that incentivize such discrimination and make recommendations for corrective actions, including potential loss of federal funding for institutions found in violation. The bill mandates quarterly reports and includes a sunset clause. It also amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to withhold federal funds from institutions found to be discriminating based on race.",
