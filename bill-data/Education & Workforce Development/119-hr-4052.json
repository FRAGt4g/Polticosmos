    "summary": "The Employment Abundance Act mandates reviews of job classifications by federal contractors and executive agencies to identify positions requiring a college degree without demonstrable occupational necessity. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council and the Office of Personnel Management are tasked with issuing regulations for these reviews. Contractors and agencies must report their findings, including plans to revise job classifications with alternative criteria like experience or skills. Non-compliance can lead to administrative actions. The bill does not prevent maintaining degree requirements when necessary or mandated.",
