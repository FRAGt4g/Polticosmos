    "summary": "The 'Ending Punitive, Unfair, School-based Harm that is Overt and Unresponsive to Trauma Act of 2025' (Ending PUSHOUT Act of 2025) aims to reduce exclusionary discipline practices in schools. It mandates data collection on disciplinary actions, provides grants for schools to implement alternatives to suspension/expulsion, and establishes a joint task force to address pushout of girls of color. The bill prohibits certain disciplinary measures like corporal punishment and specific restraints, and is authorized for substantial appropriations to support these initiatives. It focuses on addressing the disproportionate impact of disciplinary actions on marginalized student groups.",
