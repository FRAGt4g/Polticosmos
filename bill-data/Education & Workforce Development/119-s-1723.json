The bill amends sections of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to address funding allotments, facilities financing, and state aid programs. It also provides for technical assistance, research, and dissemination related to charter school facilities and programs, and authorizes appropriations over several fiscal years. The act prioritizes increased access to facilities funding, public buildings, and facilities in low-income and rural communities.",
