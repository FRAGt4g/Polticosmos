    "summary": "The \"One Door to Work Act\" amends the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to establish a State innovation demonstration authority. It allows states, local areas, or consortia to apply for consolidated grants for 5-year demonstration projects, waiving certain statutory and regulatory requirements to pursue innovative reforms for job seekers, employers, and taxpayers. The bill includes provisions for evaluations, performance accountability, and limitations on the number of approved projects. Projects must meet specific requirements regarding fund usage, administrative costs, service priorities, participant numbers, and reporting. The act also outlines performance standards and potential sanctions, and grants the Secretary of Labor the ability to approve or disapprove applications.",
