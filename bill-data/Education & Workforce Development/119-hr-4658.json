    "summary": "This bill, the \"Stopping Teachers Unions from Damaging Education Needs Today Act\" (STUDENT Act), aims to impose new requirements on the National Education Association (NEA). It cites concerns about the NEA's political activities, stances on social issues, and alleged obstruction of school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill proposes amendments to Title 36 of the United States Code, including restrictions on NEA political contributions, lobbying, and advocacy related to specified beliefs. It also addresses membership dues collection, non-discrimination, and reporting requirements, ultimately seeking to limit the scope and influence of the NEA.",
