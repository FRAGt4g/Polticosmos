    "summary": "The Universal School Choice Act proposes amending the Internal Revenue Code to provide tax credits for individuals and corporations that donate to scholarship-granting organizations. These organizations would provide scholarships for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses, including tuition, materials, and other related costs for eligible students. The bill establishes a volume cap on the total amount of credits allowed, with provisions for allocation and adjustments. It also includes measures to ensure organizational autonomy and parental rights concerning school choice.",
