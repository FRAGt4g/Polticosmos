    "summary": "The 'Measures for Safer School Districts Act' aims to enhance elementary and secondary school safety. It mandates local educational agencies to implement emergency response procedures, including timely notification to parents about covered threats and emergencies (e.g., weapons possession, active shooter situations). The bill also directs the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to establish a rulemaking advisory committee to develop recommendations for installing or modifying interior and exterior doors in schools, aiming to improve security. The bill allocates $100 million annually for ten years through the Homeland Security Grant Program to support these measures.",
