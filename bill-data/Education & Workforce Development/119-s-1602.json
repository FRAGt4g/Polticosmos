    "summary": "This bill, the Mathematical and Statistical Modeling Education Act, aims to modernize mathematics education in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) by emphasizing mathematical and statistical modeling, data science, and computational thinking. It directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to provide grants to institutions of higher education and nonprofits for research and development to improve math education in schools. The bill also calls for a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) study on the implementation of these practices and related reforms. Funding is authorized for both grant programs and the NASEM study over several fiscal years. The act expires September 30, 2029.",
