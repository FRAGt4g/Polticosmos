    "summary": "The Fairness in Higher Education Accreditation Act aims to modify criteria for accrediting agencies for higher education institutions. It prohibits accrediting agencies from considering race, color, sex, or national origin in the composition of students, faculty, or staff, or in leadership or honors. It mandates agencies to allow institutions to adopt any lawful policies regarding these factors. The bill also defines \"free inquiry\" and provides exemptions for religious institutions, ensuring they are not subject to certain free inquiry requirements. It allows institutions denied accreditation due to these new rules to pursue civil action.",
