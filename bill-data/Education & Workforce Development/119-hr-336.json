    "summary": "The 'HEADWAY Act' (H.R. 336) aims to address workforce shortages in Early Head Start programs by amending teacher credentialing rules. The bill requires at least one fully credentialed teacher per classroom, rather than all of them. It allows additional teachers to be employed while they work towards earning a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential, provided they are guided by a mentor. Sponsored by representatives from both parties, this legislation creates a flexible 'earn-while-you-learn' pathway into the early childhood education workforce, helping fill critical staffing gaps in centers serving young children and families.",
