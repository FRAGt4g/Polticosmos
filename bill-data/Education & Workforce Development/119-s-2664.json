    "summary": "The Skilled Workforce Act proposes amending the Internal Revenue Code to establish a 'qualifying workforce training project credit.' This credit provides a 30% tax credit to eligible taxpayers for investments in projects that equip, expand, or enhance institutions addressing workforce shortages in specific sectors like manufacturing, energy, construction, and transportation. The bill defines eligible taxpayers, projects, and institutions (including public schools, vocational schools, and community colleges) and outlines a certification program administered by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, with a $500 million credit allocation cap. The bill also includes provisions for elective payment and transfer of the credit, conforming amendments, authorization of appropriations and an effective date.",
