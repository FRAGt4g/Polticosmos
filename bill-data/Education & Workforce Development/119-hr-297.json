    "summary": "The \"Higher Education Loses Payments for Painful Experiments, Tests and Studies Act\" (HELP PETS Act) would prohibit federal funding for institutions of higher education that conduct or finance painful research on dogs and cats. Taking effect 180 days after enactment, the bill defines \"painful research\" as procedures in pain categories D or E, as classified by the Department of Agriculture. It provides exceptions for clinical veterinary research performed for the animal's benefit and for studies related to service and military animals. The legislation aims to prevent federal funds from supporting these experiments in academic settings.",
