    "summary": "The 'Achieving Choice in Education Act' aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide financial incentives for education. Key provisions include expanding 529 account usage to cover homeschool and various elementary/secondary education expenses, increasing the annual distribution limit from 529 plans, and offering gift tax exclusions for contributions to 529 plans. The bill also restricts tax-exempt bonds to states with school choice programs, defining criteria for 'minimum school choice states' and specifying eligible school choice programs like tax credit scholarships and voucher programs.",
