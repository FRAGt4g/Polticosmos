    "summary": "The SPORTS Act aims to protect student-athletes' name, image, and likeness (NIL) rights, allowing them to profit from their brand. It prohibits restrictions by institutions, conferences, and associations, with limited exceptions. The bill mandates disclosure of NIL agreements, modifies the Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act, and outlines roles for conferences and associations, including a fair market value database. It also ties eligibility for Department of Education funding to providing athlete support and requires medical care for injuries. Furthermore, it limits liability for institutions and preempts conflicting state laws.",
