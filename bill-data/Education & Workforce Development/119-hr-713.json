    "summary": "This bill, the Preventing Financial Exploitation in Higher Education Act, aims to penalize institutions of higher education with high student loan default, delinquency, and underpayment rates. It amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to impose financial penalties on institutions based on these rates, phasing in penalties over several years. Additionally, it increases taxes on certain educational institutions with large endowments that increase tuition costs, as well as amends their program participation agreements.",
