    "summary": "The STOP Bullying Act aims to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a grant program for states. These grants would support the creation of anti-bullying task forces. These task forces will study, address, and reduce bullying in elementary and secondary schools. The bill outlines the requirements for the task forces, including membership composition (teachers, administrators, parents, students, counselors, etc.), study focus (bullying policies, education, violence), and reporting obligations (findings, recommendations, best practices) to the Chief Education Officer and Secretary of Education.",
