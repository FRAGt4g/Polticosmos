It directs the National Science Foundation to award grants to institutions of higher education for research on makerspaces' effectiveness in STEM education and workforce preparedness. The bill prioritizes applicants partnering with workforce development entities, community colleges, and minority-serving institutions, particularly those operating in rural communities. Funds can be used for research, equipment, and dissemination of best practices, with limitations on building construction, and provision for technical assistance.",
