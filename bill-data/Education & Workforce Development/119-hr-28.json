    "summary": "The \"Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025\" amends Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to define sex based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth for the purpose of athletics. This would make it a violation for any recipient of federal financial assistance, such as schools, to permit a person assigned male at birth to participate in athletic programs or activities designated for women or girls. The bill also commissions a study on the psychological, developmental, and sociological results of allowing males to compete in women's sports.",
