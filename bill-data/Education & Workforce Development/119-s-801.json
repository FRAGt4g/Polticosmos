Key provisions include simplifying federal student loans (introducing 'Federal Direct simplification loans'), phasing out loan forgiveness, reforming accreditation by allowing state-level alternative accreditation systems, and increasing transparency by requiring institutions to publish detailed information on student outcomes and financial aid. The bill also introduces school accountability for student loans through a default rate fine and allows for flexibility in student counseling.",
