    "summary": "The Leveraging and Energizing America\u2019s Apprenticeship Programs Act (LEAP Act) amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit to employers for employees participating in qualified apprenticeship programs. The credit is $1,500 per apprenticeship employee exceeding the applicable level, limited to two taxable years per employee. The bill outlines definitions for 'apprenticeship employee' and 'apprenticeship program,' provides guidelines to determine the 'applicable apprenticeship level,' and includes exclusions for certain industries and coordination with other credits. Additionally, it calls for a reduction in government printing costs by promoting online publication and creating guidelines for employee printing and public document information.",
