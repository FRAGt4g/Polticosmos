    "summary": "The Clock Hour Program Student Protection Act amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to clarify clock hour requirements for certain eligible programs. The bill focuses on programs that train students for gainful employment in recognized professions, setting limits on the number of clock hours that can be offered. It specifies that programs exceeding state-mandated clock hours are eligible if they don't surpass 150% of the state's minimum or 150% of a federal agency's requirement. The amendment takes effect upon enactment, applying retroactively to the 2024-2025 award year.",
