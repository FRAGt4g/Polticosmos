    "summary": "The Alyssa's Legacy Youth in Schools Safety Alert Act aims to improve school safety by requiring elementary and secondary schools to be equipped with silent panic alarms. The bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, mandating local educational agencies (LEAs) to ensure schools are prepared for security emergencies, including non-fire evacuations, lockdowns, and active shooter situations. It defines 'panic alarm' as a silent security system signal for life-threatening emergencies requiring law enforcement response, making the presence of the alarm a condition for receiving federal funds.
