    "summary": "The 'Understanding Student Parent Outcomes Act of 2025' aims to improve data collection on student parents in higher education. It mandates the Commissioner of Education Statistics to create a standard definition of 'parenting student,' develop new data elements within the IPEDS system, and collect/disaggregate data on various aspects like enrollment, retention, income, and childcare usage. The Secretary of Education will also conduct a study on best practices to support these students and report the findings. Technical assistance will be provided to states and institutions.",
