    "summary": "This bill, the School Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (SIFIA Act), amends the Internal Revenue Code to introduce SIFIA bonds. These bonds provide a tax credit for investors, incentivizing investment in the design, construction, and renovation of qualified school facilities, particularly net-zero energy buildings. The bonds are issued by states or local educational agencies in partnership with private, for-profit entities. The bill sets limitations on the total amount of bonds issued, and includes provisions for rural area set-asides and reporting requirements. The program's effectiveness is contingent on private partnerships and building maintenance performance. The credit also has a limit based on the taxpayer's regular tax and other credits.",
