The bill specifies that students must meet eligibility requirements under the Higher Education Act of 1965 to be excluded. It also mandates that applicable educational institutions report the number of students used in the calculation, both before and after the exclusion, on their tax returns. The changes apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.",
