    "summary": "This bill, the Local School Foods Expansion Act of 2025, aims to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. It establishes a program to procure domestically grown, unprocessed fruits and vegetables for school meals, replacing a pilot project. The bill expands the program's scope, including increasing participating states, adding criteria for state selection (commitment to small farmers and tribal communities), and mandating program evaluation and reporting. It allocates $25 million annually from 2026-2030 to fund the program and provides funds for administrative costs and technical assistance.",
