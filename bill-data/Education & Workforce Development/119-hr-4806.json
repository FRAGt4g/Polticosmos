    "summary": "The College Transparency Act (HR 4806) mandates the establishment of a postsecondary student data system. This system, maintained by the Commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, will collect and analyze student-level data to evaluate enrollment, completion, outcomes, and costs. The bill outlines data elements to be included, establishes an advisory committee, and ensures data privacy and security. It directs data sharing with other federal agencies and requires the public release of aggregate information while prohibiting the sale of collected data. Institutions participating in Title IV programs are required to submit data.",
