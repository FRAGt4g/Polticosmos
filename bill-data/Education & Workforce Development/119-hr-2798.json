    "summary": "This bill, the High-Quality Charter Schools Act, amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a tax credit for charitable donations made to eligible charter school organizations for the creation or expansion of charter schools. It defines 'eligible charter school organizations' and sets requirements for them, including audits and expenditure deadlines. The bill also establishes a volume cap for the tax credit, allocates it between states and a nationwide pool, and mandates a real-time tracking system. It emphasizes organizational and parental autonomy, and sets an effective date for the amendments.",
