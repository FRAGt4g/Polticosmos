    "summary": "The 'Employer-Directed Skills Act' amends the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to establish employer-directed skills accounts. It defines 'employer-sponsored skills development' and provides guidelines for employer contributions and federal funding. The Act details requirements for agreements, outlines career services updates, and establishes the administration of these accounts, including payment mechanisms for on-the-job training and employer-sponsored programs, with the intent of facilitating employee training. This will be done through establishing various agreements, as well as detailing eligibility.",
