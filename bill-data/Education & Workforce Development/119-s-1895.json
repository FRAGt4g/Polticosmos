It establishes a program where the Secretary of Education partners with eligible graduate institutions to cover a portion of participating students' tuition costs, matched by contributions from the institutions. The bill outlines program requirements, including outreach, reporting, and evaluations. It authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2026-2030 to fund this initiative. The bill defines key terms like 'eligible graduate institution' and 'school-based mental health field.'",
