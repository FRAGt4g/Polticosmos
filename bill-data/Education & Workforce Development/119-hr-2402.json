    "summary": "The No Hungry Kids in Schools Act (H.R. 2402) aims to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. It introduces a statewide community eligibility program, allowing states to provide funding to cover the free reimbursement rate for all meals served at eligible schools. This would eliminate the threshold for free meals and adjust the multiplier used in these programs for states that choose to participate.",
