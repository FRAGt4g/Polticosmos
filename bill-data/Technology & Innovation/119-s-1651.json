    "summary": "The 'Lowering Broadband Costs for Consumers Act of 2025' mandates the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reform the Universal Service Fund. This includes requiring contributions from broadband providers and edge providers to support universal service mechanisms, expanding the contribution base, and establishing a new mechanism within the high-cost program to aid eligible telecommunications carriers. The goal is to lower consumer broadband costs, ensuring equitable contributions, and promoting affordable and available broadband in high-cost areas. The bill also defines key terms such as 'broadband provider' and 'edge provider'.",
