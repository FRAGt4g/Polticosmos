    "summary": "The Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2025 directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to require impact assessments of automated decision systems and augmented critical decision processes. It defines key terms like \"augmented critical decision process,\" \"automated decision system,\" and \"covered entity.\" The bill mandates impact assessments by covered entities, requiring documentation, stakeholder consultation, and annual summary reports to the FTC. It also establishes a public repository for information, authorizes funding for the FTC, and outlines enforcement mechanisms, including state attorney general actions and coordination with other agencies. The act aims to increase transparency and accountability in the use of AI systems with the goals of consumer protection and civil rights.",
