    "summary": "The Connected Vehicle National Security Review Act (S. 2040) aims to address national security concerns related to connected vehicles by establishing the Office of Information and Communications Technology and Services (OICTS) within the Department of Commerce. The bill defines key terms like 'connected vehicle,' 'covered transaction,' and 'jurisdiction of concern.' The OICTS will review covered transactions, mitigate risks through agreements or prohibitions, and issue regulations. It also mandates risk assessments from the Director of National Intelligence and sets up an ICTS advisory committee. The bill outlines enforcement measures, including investigations, penalties for violations, and judicial review processes, specifically focusing on actions related to entities of concern to ensure that they cannot undermine U.S. export controls.",
