    "summary": "The 'Unleashing AI Innovation in Financial Services Act' aims to foster AI development in the financial sector. It mandates financial regulatory agencies to establish AI Innovation Labs, allowing regulated entities to experiment with AI test projects. These labs will provide a framework for alternative compliance strategies, potentially waiving or modifying existing regulations for approved projects. The bill outlines application procedures, agency review processes (including deadlines and potential extensions), data security measures, and reporting requirements. The goal is to stimulate innovation while ensuring appropriate oversight and risk management.",
