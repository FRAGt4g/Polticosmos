    "summary": "The Rural Broadband Protection Act of 2025 mandates the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a vetting process for applicants seeking high-cost universal service program funding. This process aims to ensure that funds are awarded only to applicants with the technical, financial, and operational capabilities to deploy broadband networks and provide services.  The bill outlines the required components of an applicant's initial proposal, evaluation criteria, and penalties for non-compliance, aiming to improve accountability and efficiency in broadband deployment.",
