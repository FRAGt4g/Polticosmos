    "summary": "This bill addresses the issue of \"Misbehaving Content Scrapers,\" likely referring to unauthorized web scraping activities. It directs entities to respect robots.txt rules when accessing data and mentions IP rate limiting as a consequence of non-compliance. The bill suggests using the GPO.gov Bulk Data Download service as an alternative mechanism, indicating a focus on data access and potentially intellectual property considerations. This could be designed to protect US websites from being overloaded.",
