    "summary": "The 'Quantum Sandbox for Near-Term Applications Act of 2025' amends the National Quantum Initiative Act to establish a public-private partnership focused on accelerating the development and application of quantum computing technologies. This involves creating a 'quantum sandbox' for testing and developing near-term quantum applications (those deployable in under 24 months) across various areas like quantum computing, communication, and sensing. The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with NIST and other stakeholders like the Quantum Economic Development Consortium, will oversee this initiative.",
