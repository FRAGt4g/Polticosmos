    "summary": "The Chip Security Act mandates the Secretary of Commerce to establish chip security mechanisms for integrated circuit products exported from the United States.  These mechanisms, using techniques like location verification, aim to prevent diversion and unauthorized use, enhancing national security and compliance with export control laws. The bill outlines primary requirements, secondary requirements developed through assessments, and enforcement authorities, including record-keeping and annual evaluations of new chip security mechanisms to facilitate export control flexibility. The goal is to safeguard advanced technologies to bolster US competitiveness and address national security concerns related to chip exports.",
