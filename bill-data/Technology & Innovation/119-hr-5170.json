    "summary": "This bill, the Cable Access for Broadband and Local Economic Leadership Act (CABLE Leadership Act), amends the Communications Act of 1934 regarding cable franchises. It sets a 120-day timeframe for franchising authorities to approve or deny new franchise requests, with a deemed-approval if the deadline is missed. It defines when a request is considered complete, specifies requirements for denial decisions, and prohibits tolling the timeframe. The bill aims to streamline the approval process for cable franchises.",
