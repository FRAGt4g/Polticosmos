    "summary": "The Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2025 directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to regulate algorithmic impact assessments. It mandates covered entities (companies meeting certain size criteria) to assess the impact of their algorithms on consumers, focusing on critical decisions like access to education, financial services, healthcare, and housing. The bill requires the FTC to create regulations, including guidelines for impact assessments, summary reports, and a publicly accessible repository of algorithm information. The FTC will also establish a Bureau of Technology to aid in enforcement.",
