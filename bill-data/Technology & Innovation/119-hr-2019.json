    "summary": "The Terms-of-service Labeling, Design, and Readability Act (TLDR Act) mandates that online service providers create user-friendly summaries and data flow diagrams for their terms of service. It requires accessible, machine-readable summaries, data flow diagrams illustrating data sharing, and interactive data format tagging of terms.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would enforce the act, with states also having enforcement authority.  The bill defines key terms like 'sensitive information' and 'covered entity' and outlines specific contents for the required summary statements.",
