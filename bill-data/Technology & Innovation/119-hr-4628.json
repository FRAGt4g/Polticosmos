    "summary": "The AI Impersonation Prevention Act of 2025 aims to prohibit the use of artificial intelligence to impersonate federal officials. The bill amends Title 18 of the United States Code to punish individuals who knowingly use AI to create materially false or misleading content mimicking federal officers, including voice or likeness, without clear disclaimers. It defines AI and impersonation, and includes exceptions for satire, parody, and First Amendment-protected expressive conduct with appropriate disclosures. The Act also includes a severability clause.",
