    "summary": "The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act aims to provide a safe harbor for non-controlling blockchain developers and providers of blockchain services from various licensing and registration requirements typically applied to money transmitters and financial institutions. The bill defines key terms like 'blockchain developer,' 'blockchain network,' and 'digital asset,' and clarifies that the safe harbor applies unless the developer or provider controls digital assets. It also addresses the interplay between the Act and intellectual property laws and state laws.",
