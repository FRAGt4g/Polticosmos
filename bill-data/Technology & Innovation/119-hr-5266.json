    "summary": "This bill, the 5G Using Previously Granted Rulings that Accelerate Deployment Everywhere Act of 2025 (or the 5G UPGRADE Act of 2025), amends the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 to set a clear timeframe for state and local governments to review requests for modification of existing wireless facilities. It includes a 'deemed approval' clause if a decision isn't made within 60 days, addresses incomplete submissions, and limits the documentation that can be required. Additionally, it provides for enforcement through federal district courts and mandates the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue final rules within 180 days of enactment. The amendments apply to eligible facilities requests submitted after the bill's enactment.",
