    "summary": "The End Crypto Corruption Act of 2025 aims to prevent conflicts of interest and potential corruption related to digital assets. It prohibits high-ranking government officials (President, Vice President, Members of Congress, and Senate-confirmed appointees) from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing cryptocurrencies and similar financial instruments. The bill amends existing laws to establish civil and criminal penalties for violations, including fines, imprisonment, and disgorgement of profits. Additionally, it clarifies that prohibited transactions are considered unofficial acts and beyond the scope of official duties.",
