    "summary": "The 'Compliant Operations of Decentralized Entities Act of 2025' mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to create a public-private partnership program to develop anti-money laundering solutions for decentralized finance (DeFi) services. This involves integrating compliance controls into smart contracts, testing them, and providing recommendations. The bill also requires FinCEN to issue an advisory and the Secretary of the Treasury to create rules defining DeFi services and requiring risk-based AML and sanctions compliance programs. The program excludes DeFi services controlled by covered individuals (government officials and their families) and sunsets after 18 months, with a related advisory from FinCEN after 18 months, and final rule making after 30 months.",
