    "summary": "The Wireless Broadband Competition and Efficient Deployment Act aims to streamline the deployment of wireless broadband infrastructure. It exempts certain projects involving the collocation or modification of personal wireless service facilities from environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and historical preservation reviews under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The bill defines key terms like 'covered project' and 'eligible personal wireless service facility' to clarify the scope of these exemptions, with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) having jurisdiction.",
