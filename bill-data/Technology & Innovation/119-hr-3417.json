    "summary": "The Websites and Software Applications Accessibility Act of 2025 aims to establish uniform accessibility standards for websites and applications used by various entities, including employers, public entities, and public accommodations, to ensure they are accessible to individuals with disabilities. The bill mandates the Department of Justice and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to create and enforce these standards, addressing the exclusion of individuals with disabilities in the digital landscape. It provides for public and private enforcement, establishes advisory committees, technical assistance programs, and grants for small entities to achieve compliance. The goal is to ensure equal access to information and services for individuals with disabilities in the digital world.",
