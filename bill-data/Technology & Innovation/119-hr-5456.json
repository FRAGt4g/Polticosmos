    "summary": "The NOAA Weather Radio Modernization Act of 2025 aims to upgrade and modernize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio All Hazards network. It mandates the Administrator to expand coverage, ensure reliability, and enhance access to broadcasts, especially in underserved areas. The bill outlines plans for infrastructure upgrades, software enhancements, stakeholder consultation, backup capabilities, and research into alternative transmission methods. It also requires an assessment of NOAA Weather Radio access, considering factors like real-time broadcasts, third-party platform compatibility, management systems, interagency coordination, and potential impacts of electromagnetic events.",
