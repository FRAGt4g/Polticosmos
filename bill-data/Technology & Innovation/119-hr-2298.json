    "summary": "The 'Reducing Barriers for Broadband on Federal Lands Act of 2025' aims to expedite broadband infrastructure deployment on federal lands.

The bill defines key terms like 'broadband project,' 'broadband provider,' 'Federal authorization,' and 'right-of-way,' clarifying its scope and intended impact on broadband expansion.",
