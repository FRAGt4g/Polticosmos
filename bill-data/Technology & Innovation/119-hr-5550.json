    "summary": "The Lower Internet Costs Act aims to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to increase transparency in broadband service pricing. It mandates that broadband providers clearly state the aggregate price for their service on bills and in promotional materials. The bill also prohibits providers from charging specific fees, including those for compliance with state regulations, network maintenance, local access, and technical support. The FCC is directed to create regulations to enforce these requirements.",
