    "summary": "This bill addresses the issue of \"Misbehaving Content Scrapers,\" likely focusing on online data collection practices. It instructs scrapers to respect robots.txt and notes that the scraper's IP has been rate-limited, directing them towards the Government Publishing Office's (GPO) bulk data download resource for legitimate data acquisition. The bill appears to be more of a notice or warning concerning data scraping and compliance with site rules.",
