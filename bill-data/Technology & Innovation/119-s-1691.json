    "summary": "The Traveler Privacy Protection Act of 2025 aims to limit the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) use of facial recognition technology in airports. It defines terms like 'biometric information' and 'affirmative express consent,' and restricts how the TSA can collect, store, and share passenger biometric data. It allows for the use of facial recognition for trusted traveler programs with opt-out options and requires affirmative consent for general passengers. The bill also mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the effectiveness, accuracy, and privacy implications of the technology.",
