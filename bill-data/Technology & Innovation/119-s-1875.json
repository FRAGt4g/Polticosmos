    "summary": "The Streamlining Federal Cybersecurity Regulations Act of 2025 aims to harmonize cybersecurity requirements across federal agencies. It establishes a Harmonization Committee, led by the National Cyber Director, to develop a regulatory framework including baseline and sector-specific requirements. The bill mandates consultation with the Committee before agencies promulgate new or amended cybersecurity rules. It also establishes a pilot program to test the framework and provides guidance for agencies. The goal is to enhance cybersecurity and improve efficiency by aligning regulations and promoting reciprocity among agencies.",
