    "summary": "The Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2025 mandates the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to auction spectrum within the 1.3-13.2 GHz band, identifying spectrum for reallocation from federal and shared use to non-federal use, including commercial licenses.  It sets deadlines for spectrum identification, auctions, and unlicensed spectrum availability, along with reporting requirements for the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and the FCC. The bill also modifies the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act, focusing on spectrum relocation costs and congressional notification timelines.",
