The bill grants individuals harmed by violations the right to civil action, including damages and attorney's fees. It also amends the Internal Revenue Code to prevent disclosure of tax return information to individuals with unauthorized system access and establishes civil damages for unauthorized inspection or disclosure of such information.",
