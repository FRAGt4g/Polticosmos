    "summary": "H.R. 391, titled the \"Extend the TikTok Deadline Act,\" proposes an amendment to the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.\" The bill's sole purpose is to extend the time allowed for the divestiture of TikTok by its parent company to avoid a nationwide ban. Specifically, it seeks to change the deadline for the sale from the original 270 days to 540 days. This would grant the company an additional 270 days to complete a sale to an approved buyer, effectively postponing the date a potential ban would take effect.",
