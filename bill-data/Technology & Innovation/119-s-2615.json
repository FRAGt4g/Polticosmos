    "summary": "The VET Artificial Intelligence Act directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop voluntary guidelines and specifications for internal and external assurance of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It aims to build trust, increase adoption, and provide accountability for AI. The bill defines various terms related to AI assurance, including 'artificial intelligence system,' 'deployer,' 'developer,' and 'external/internal assurance.' It mandates stakeholder outreach, public comment, and a report on the capabilities of entities conducting AI assurances, with recommendations for improvement.  A qualifications advisory committee will also provide recommendations related to the qualifications of parties performing AI assurances.",
