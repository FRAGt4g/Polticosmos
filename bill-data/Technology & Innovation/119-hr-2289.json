    "summary": "The bill, titled the Proportional Reviews for Broadband Deployment Act, aims to streamline the deployment of broadband infrastructure by exempting eligible facilities requests from certain environmental and historical preservation reviews. Specifically, it amends Section 6409(a)(3) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 to state that such requests are not subject to major Federal action reviews under NEPA or undertakings under NHPA, thus facilitating faster deployment.",
