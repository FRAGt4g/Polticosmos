    "summary": "The Liquid Cooling for AI Act of 2025 directs the Comptroller General to assess liquid-cooling systems for AI compute clusters and high-performance computing. It mandates a review of research needs, costs/benefits, and market trends. The bill also requires the development of best-practice guidance for federal agencies and focuses on coolant options, failure mitigation, and heat reuse. A report to Congress and the Department of Energy is required, followed by an assessment and recommendations, including the importance of liquid cooling for maintaining U.S. leadership in AI technologies.",
