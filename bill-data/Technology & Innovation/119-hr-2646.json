    "summary": "The Radar Gap Elimination Act mandates the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere to develop a plan to improve the United States' weather radar network. This includes establishing the Radar Next Program to replace the existing NEXRAD system, determining requirements for radar coverage, developing a proof-of-concept radar, and exploring options like 'Radar-as-a-Service' to address coverage gaps. The plan must be fully implemented by September 30, 2040, and the Under Secretary must provide updates to Congress.",
