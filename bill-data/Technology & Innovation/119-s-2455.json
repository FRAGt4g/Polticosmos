    "summary": "The Transparency and Responsibility for Artificial Intelligence Networks Act (TRAIN Act) proposes to amend US copyright law to allow copyright holders to subpoena developers of AI models. This aims to determine if their copyrighted works were used in training the AI models. The bill defines key terms like \"artificial intelligence model,\" \"developer,\" and \"training material.\" It outlines the process for requesting, issuing, and responding to subpoenas, including confidentiality requirements, a rebuttable presumption for non-compliance, and sanctions for bad-faith requests. It amends Chapter 5 of Title 17, United States Code.",
