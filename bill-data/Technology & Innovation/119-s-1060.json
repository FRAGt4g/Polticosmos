    "summary": "The Advertising Middlemen Endangering Rigorous Internet Competition Accountability Act (AMERICA Act) aims to promote competition and transparency in the digital advertising market. It amends the Clayton Act to prevent conflicts of interest by restricting ownership of digital advertising exchanges, buy-side brokerages, and sell-side brokerages under specific revenue thresholds. The bill also introduces requirements for brokerages to act in the best interests of their customers, provide transparency regarding transactions, including detailed data available to customers, and disclose routing practices. Enforcement mechanisms include actions by the Attorney General, State Attorneys General, and a private right of action for harmed brokerage customers.",
