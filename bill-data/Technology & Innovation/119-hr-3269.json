It limits the number of patents that can be asserted in an infringement lawsuit against generic drug manufacturers and biosimilar applicants to one per \"Patent Group.\" A Patent Group is defined based on common ownership and disclaimers filed under section 253 of the United States Code. This change applies to applications submitted after the Act's enactment.",
