    "summary": "The Responsible Innovation and Safe Expertise Act of 2025 (RISE Act) aims to establish a framework for AI liability.  It grants limited immunity to AI developers from civil liability for errors generated by their AI products if used by learned professionals, provided the developers meet specific transparency requirements. These requirements include releasing model cards and specifications, along with limitations documentation. The immunity is conditional, excluding recklessness or willful misconduct, and requires updates to information when new versions are deployed or material failure modes are discovered. The bill specifically focuses on professional service applications of AI, seeking to balance innovation with public safety.",
