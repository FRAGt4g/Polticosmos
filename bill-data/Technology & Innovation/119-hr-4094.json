    "summary": "The Electronic Consent Accountability Act of 2025 mandates that federal agencies report to Congress on their implementation of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance related to the disclosure of personal information. Specifically, it focuses on agencies' adherence to OMB Memorandum M\u201321\u201304, requiring them to report on whether they've adopted electronic identity verification, standardized consent forms, and acceptance of electronic consent. Agencies are required to submit reports to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform within 120 days of the act's enactment. Agencies that have not implemented the guidance must provide justifications, timelines, and implementation steps.",
