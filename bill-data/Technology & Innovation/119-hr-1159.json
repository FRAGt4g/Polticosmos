    "summary": "This bill addresses the actions of a \"Misbehaving Content Scraper.\" It instructs the scraper to respect robots.txt rules and acknowledges that its IP address has been rate limited. It directs the scraper to use the GPO.gov Bulk Data Download service (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/) for data acquisition. The bill appears to be a technical or operational directive regarding accessing data from government resources rather than addressing broader societal issues.",
