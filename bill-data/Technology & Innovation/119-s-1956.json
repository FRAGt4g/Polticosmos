    "summary": "The 'Strengthening Agency Management and Oversight of Software Assets Act' aims to improve how federal agencies manage and oversee their software assets. It mandates agencies to conduct comprehensive assessments of their software, including entitlements, costs, and interoperability. Based on these assessments, agencies will develop plans to consolidate software, improve acquisition strategies, and modernize software management. The bill also requires reports from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office to assess government-wide practices and make recommendations. No additional funds are authorized.",
