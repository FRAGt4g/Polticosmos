    "summary": "The Digital Integrity in Democracy Act aims to hold social media platforms accountable for hosting false election administration information. It amends Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 to remove liability protections for platforms that knowingly host such information. The bill defines \"false election administration information,\" outlines a removal process, and specifies penalties including fines and injunctive relief. It provides a safe harbor for platforms that promptly remove the information upon notification or discovery, and clarifies the effective date of the Act to apply to information hosted on or after the date of enactment.",
