    "summary": "This bill addresses the issue of \"Misbehaving Content Scrapers\", likely websites or automated programs that are violating terms of service or attempting to scrape data without permission. It directs the scraper to adhere to the `robots.txt` file (a protocol specifying which parts of a website a web crawler is allowed to access) and informs the scraper that their IP address has been rate limited. Notably, it also recommends using the GPO.gov Bulk Data Download service for data acquisition, suggesting a preferred and sanctioned method. The bill likely seeks to improve access to government data while discouraging unauthorized data scraping.",
