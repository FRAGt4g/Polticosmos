    "summary": "This bill, the Weather Innovation for the Next Generation Act of 2025 (WING Act of 2025), aims to improve weather radar capabilities by researching the impact of obstructions, such as wind turbines and buildings, on radar detection and prediction. It directs the National Weather Service to establish a program to identify and test mitigation strategies, including signal processing, forecasting algorithms, and the use of dual polarization characteristics. The program will prioritize specific technology-based solutions and report to Congress, recommending further research and development. The bill defines key terms like 'beam blockage' and 'ghost echo' and includes a termination date.",
