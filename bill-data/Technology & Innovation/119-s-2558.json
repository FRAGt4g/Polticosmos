    "summary": "This bill, the National Quantum Cybersecurity Migration Strategy Act of 2025, addresses the emerging threat of quantum computers to existing cryptographic systems. It mandates the Subcommittee on the Economic and Security Implications of Quantum Information Science to develop a national strategy for Federal agencies to transition to post-quantum cryptography. This includes defining relevant quantum computers, assessing migration urgency, establishing performance measures, and creating a pilot program involving sector risk management agencies. The bill also requires the Office of Electronic Government to survey agencies about migration costs and report findings to Congress, along with assessments from the Comptroller General.",
