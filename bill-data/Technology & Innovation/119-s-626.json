    "summary": "The 'Stopping Online Confusion for Investigative Agencies and Law-enforcement by Maintaining Evidence Determined Interparty Arrangements Act' (SOCIAL MEDIA Act) aims to improve communication between social media platforms and law enforcement. Key provisions include requiring platforms to create law enforcement portals with contact information and policy details. It also establishes a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Platform Safety Advisory Committee to recommend uniform reporting metrics on illegal content monitoring, responsiveness to inquiries, and collaboration with law enforcement. The FTC will then issue guidance and platforms must report these metrics annually. Enforcement falls to the FTC.",
