    "summary": "The Keep Your Coins Act of 2025 aims to prevent federal agencies from restricting the use of convertible virtual currency (like cryptocurrencies) for personal purchases. It prohibits agencies from impairing a user's ability to use these currencies for goods/services or to self-custody their digital assets. The bill defines convertible virtual currencies, covered users, and self-hosted wallets, ensuring individuals can maintain control over their digital assets.",
