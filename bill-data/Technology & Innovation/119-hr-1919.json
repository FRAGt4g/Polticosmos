    "summary": "The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act (HR 1919) aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from offering products or services directly to individuals, maintaining individual accounts, and issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The bill also prohibits the use of CBDCs for monetary policy and restricts the Board of Governors from testing, developing, or implementing a CBDC. It defines CBDC and includes a 'Sense of Congress' declaring that the Federal Reserve currently lacks the authority to issue a CBDC.",
