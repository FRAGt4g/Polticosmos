    "summary": "This bill addresses the issue of \"misbehaving content scrapers.\" It instructs scrapers to respect robots.txt rules when accessing web content and warns that their IP addresses may be rate-limited. It suggests using the GPO.gov Bulk Data Download service (accessible at https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/) as an alternative method for obtaining bulk data. The bill implicitly aims to regulate data collection practices and ensure access to government information while preventing website overload and promoting responsible data usage.",
