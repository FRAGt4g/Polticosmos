    "summary": "This bill mandates the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to audit the federal government's use of the electromagnetic spectrum. It requires an audit of spectrum allocation, including which bands are used, for what purposes, where, and by whom. The Assistant Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 18 months, coordinating with the Secretary of Transportation to avoid duplication. The report will be unclassified, though a classified annex is permitted.",
