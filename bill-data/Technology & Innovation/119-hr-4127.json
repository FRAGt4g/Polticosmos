    "summary": "The Tech Safety for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking Act aims to combat technology-related abuse. It establishes a pilot program where grants are awarded to consortia (comprising higher education institutions or technical partners and domestic/sexual violence centers) to address this issue. The bill also authorizes a grant program for creating educational materials and providing technical assistance to organizations supporting victims. The bill defines technological abuse and outlines grant limits and required consultation with relevant stakeholders. Reports on the pilot program's effectiveness are mandated.",
