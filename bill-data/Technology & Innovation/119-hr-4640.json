    "summary": "The 'Stop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act of 2025' prohibits the use of algorithmic decision systems for surveillance-based price setting and wage setting. It defines these terms and outlines exceptions, such as price differences based on costs or discounts for specific groups with publicly disclosed criteria. The bill grants enforcement powers to the Federal Trade Commission and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, allows for state and private actions, and invalidates pre-dispute arbitration agreements related to violations. It requires public disclosure of procedures for automated decision systems and emphasizes the preservation of collective bargaining rights and state laws providing additional protections.",
