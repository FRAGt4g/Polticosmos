    "summary": "The App Store Freedom Act aims to promote competition in the app marketplace. It mandates that companies controlling app stores and operating systems allow users to choose third-party apps and stores, install them without restrictions, and hide or delete pre-installed apps. It also prohibits exclusivity, tying of in-app payment systems, and interference with developer-user communications. The bill grants enforcement powers to the Federal Trade Commission and allows states to take action, while also outlining rules around preemption and construction. It also defines key terms like 'covered company' and 'app store'.",
