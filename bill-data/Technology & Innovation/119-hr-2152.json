    "summary": "The AI PLAN Act mandates a strategy to defend against economic and national security risks stemming from the use of artificial intelligence in financial crimes, including fraud and misinformation. It requires the Secretaries of the Treasury, Homeland Security, and Commerce to submit annual reports to Congress, detailing interagency policies, available resources, and needed resources to combat AI-related financial crimes. These reports must consider risks like deepfakes and foreign election interference, and also include recommendations for legislation and best practices. The goal is to safeguard U.S. financial markets and entities from AI-powered threats.",
