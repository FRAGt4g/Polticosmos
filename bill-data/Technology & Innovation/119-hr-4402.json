    "summary": "The 'Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight And Regulations on Data Act of 2025' (DASHBOARD Act) targets commercial data operators. It mandates that these operators provide users with assessments of their data's economic value, identify data types collected and how they are used, and allow data deletion. The bill also requires the SEC to mandate issuers (commercial data operators) to disclose the aggregate value of user data, contracts related to data collection, and financial/legal risks. The FTC will develop regulations within 1 year. The SEC must submit a report on disclosure practices and suggest improvements. ",
