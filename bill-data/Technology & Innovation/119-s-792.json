    "summary": "This bill, the Government Spectrum Valuation Act, mandates the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to estimate the value of electromagnetic spectrum allocated to federal entities. The NTIA, in consultation with the FCC and OMB, must estimate spectrum values within specific frequency bands (3 kHz to 95 GHz) on a schedule based on enactment. The estimates will be based on commercial wireless service potential, considering government needs. The bill requires public disclosure of the methodologies used, with exceptions for classified information. Federal entities must report spectrum values in their budgets and financial statements.",
