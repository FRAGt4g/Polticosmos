    "summary": "This bill aims to modernize how federal agencies review existing regulations. It directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to report on the availability of regulations in machine-readable formats. Following this, the OMB must issue guidance for agencies on using technology, including artificial intelligence, to conduct \"retrospective reviews\" more efficiently. These reviews are intended to identify and address obsolete, excessively burdensome, or contradictory rules. Each federal agency will then be required to develop and implement a plan based on this guidance, promoting government efficiency and reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens.",
