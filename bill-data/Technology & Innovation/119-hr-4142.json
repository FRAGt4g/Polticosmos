    "summary": "The No Adversarial AI Act aims to protect the U.S. government from artificial intelligence developed by foreign adversaries. It mandates the Federal Acquisition Security Council to create and maintain a list of such AI, published by the Office of Management and Budget.  Executive agencies must review and consider excluding AI from listed foreign adversary entities. Exceptions are allowed for research, training, counterterrorism, or mission-critical functions. The bill defines key terms, including 'foreign adversary' and 'artificial intelligence'.",
