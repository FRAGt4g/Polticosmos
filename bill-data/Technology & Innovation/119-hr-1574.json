    "summary": "This bill, the \"Realizing Engineering, Science, and Technology Opportunities by Restoring Exclusive Patent Rights Act of 2025\" (RESTORE Patent Rights Act of 2025), aims to amend U.S. patent law (Title 35) to strengthen patent holders' rights. It seeks to re-establish a rebuttable presumption that a permanent injunction should be granted in cases of patent infringement, particularly addressing concerns about the ability of patent owners to halt infringement and the incentives for predatory infringement by larger entities. The legislation emphasizes the importance of strong patent protection for maintaining the U.S.'s competitive edge in innovation.",
