    "summary": "The \"Sammy's Law\" bill aims to empower parents and guardians to protect children on large social media platforms. It mandates that these platforms provide real-time application programming interfaces (APIs) to third-party safety software providers, allowing them to manage a child's online interactions, content, and account settings. The bill defines terms, outlines requirements for platform providers and software providers (including registration with the Federal Trade Commission), sets data security and disclosure guidelines, and establishes enforcement mechanisms. It also preempts state laws on this specific issue and establishes a single national standard.",
