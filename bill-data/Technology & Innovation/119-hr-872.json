    "summary": "This bill, the Federal Contractor Cybersecurity Vulnerability Reduction Act of 2025, mandates that federal contractors implement a vulnerability disclosure policy consistent with NIST guidelines. It directs the Office of Management and Budget to recommend updates to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to incorporate these requirements, and the Secretary of Defense to revise the Department of Defense FAR (DFARS) accordingly. The bill defines key terms, provides for waivers under specific conditions, and aims to improve cybersecurity for federal information systems by aligning with existing standards and best practices.",
