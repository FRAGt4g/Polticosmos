    "summary": "The Foreign Anti-Digital Piracy Act (FADPA) amends Title 17 of the United States Code to allow copyright holders to obtain court orders against foreign websites or online services that infringe on their copyrighted material. It allows for preliminary orders to block access to these infringing sites and for subsequent orders requiring service providers (like ISPs and DNS providers) to take measures to prevent their users from accessing them. The bill defines terms such as 'foreign website,' 'service provider,' and 'live event,' outlines procedures and limitations for issuing and implementing such orders, and addresses service provider immunity. It takes effect six months after enactment.",
