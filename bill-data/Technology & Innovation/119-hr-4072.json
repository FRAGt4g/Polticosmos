    "summary": "The 'Protecting and Enhancing Public Access to Codes Act of 2025' addresses the issue of copyright protection for technical standards incorporated by reference into law. The bill aims to balance the rights of standards development organizations with the public's need to access these standards. It defines key terms like 'incorporated by reference' and 'publicly accessible online,' and mandates that organizations make standards available online at no cost to retain copyright. The bill also establishes a burden of proof for those claiming non-compliance. This seeks to promote both innovation and public understanding of the law.",
