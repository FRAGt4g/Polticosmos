    "summary": "The Patent Eligibility Restoration Act of 2025 aims to clarify and expand patent eligibility in the United States. It addresses judicial exceptions to patent eligibility under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, specifying what inventions are eligible (useful processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter) and what are excluded (e.g., mathematical formulas, mental processes, unmodified human genes/natural materials, and certain processes). The bill also modifies definitions and provides guidelines for determining eligibility, including the consideration of the invention as a whole and the role of machines in practical application. It proposes changes to U.S. Code Title 35 to effect the changes.",
