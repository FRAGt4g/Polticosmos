    "summary": "This bill addresses the issue of \"Misbehaving Content Scrapers.\" It instructs these scrapers to respect robots.txt files and indicates that rate limiting may be in effect. The bill directs scrapers to use the GPO.gov Bulk Data Download service instead, providing a URL for that purpose. The implication is the bill is responding to problematic web scraping behavior and encourages a shift towards a more appropriate data acquisition method.",
