    "summary": "The Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) aims to protect children on the internet by holding online platforms accountable for harms to minors. It mandates platforms exercise reasonable care in their design features to prevent issues like eating disorders, compulsive usage, and sexual exploitation. Platforms must provide safeguards, parental tools, reporting mechanisms, and transparency reports. The bill also addresses filter bubbles, requiring platforms to allow users to view unmanipulated content. A Kids Online Safety Council is established to provide recommendations, and the FTC is tasked with issuing guidance and enforcement.",
