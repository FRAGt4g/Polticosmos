    "summary": "H.R. 148, the \"Keep Your Coins Act of 2025,\" aims to protect an individual's right to use and control their digital assets. The bill would prohibit federal agencies from restricting a person from using \"convertible virtual currency\" for personal purchases of goods and services. It also explicitly protects the right of individuals to \"self-custody\" their digital assets using self-hosted wallets, ensuring they retain independent control over their funds. This legislation seeks to prevent federal overreach into personal transactions and ownership within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, promoting financial privacy and autonomy.",
