    "summary": "The Cloud Labs to Advance Biotechnology Act of 2025 mandates the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish a cloud laboratory network. This network will coordinate cloud laboratories for biotechnology research, aiming to connect researchers with necessary capabilities, facilitate best practices in data sharing and standards, and provide access to high-quality instrumentation. The bill outlines a phased implementation, including establishing the network, developing an implementation plan, creating an advisory board, and awarding grants for cloud laboratory development. Data generated by these labs will be made accessible to researchers, and the program includes considerations for cybersecurity, biosecurity, and equitable access. The program sunsets after 12 years.",
