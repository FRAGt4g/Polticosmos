    "summary": "The 'Saving Privacy Act' (HR 2155) amends the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, focusing on bank privacy reform, warrant requirements, and exceptions. It also addresses the Consolidated Audit Trail, prohibiting the Commission from administering it and restricting federal agencies from creating similar databases collecting personally identifiable information. Further provisions include a ban on a central bank digital currency, increased congressional review of agency rulemaking, and changes to reporting requirements for third-party payment transactions and the use of convertible virtual currency. Additionally, the bill introduces criminal and civil penalties for violations of financial privacy and addresses other relief measures.",
