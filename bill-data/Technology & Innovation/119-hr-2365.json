    "summary": "The Securities Clarity Act of 2025 aims to amend securities laws to exclude \"investment contract assets\" from the definition of a security. It defines an \"investment contract asset\" as a fungible digital representation of value that can be transferred peer-to-peer without an intermediary, recorded on a public distributed ledger, and sold or transferred under an investment contract. The bill amends the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 to reflect this exclusion.",
