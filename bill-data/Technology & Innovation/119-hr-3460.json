    "summary": "The AI Whistleblower Protection Act aims to protect employees and independent contractors who report AI security vulnerabilities or violations of law. It prohibits employers from retaliating against whistleblowers and provides various avenues for redress, including filing complaints with the Secretary of Labor or bringing a civil action. The bill defines key terms like \"AI security vulnerability,\" \"AI violation,\" and \"artificial intelligence,\" and outlines remedies like reinstatement, back pay, compensatory damages, and attorney's fees. Importantly, it invalidates waivers of these rights in employment contracts.",
