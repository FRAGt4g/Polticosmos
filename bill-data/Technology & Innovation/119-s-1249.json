    "summary": "The Drone Integration and Zoning Act addresses the integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into U.S. airspace. It defines terms related to UAS, clarifies FAA authority and updates on navigable airspace, and preserves state, local, and tribal authorities regarding UAS operations, especially below 200 feet. The bill also establishes commercial routes, addresses zoning for UAS landing zones, sets rules for commercial property carriage, designates complex airspace, improves UAS traffic management, and updates safety standards. It emphasizes federal and local cooperation while aiming to balance UAS integration with property rights and safety.",
