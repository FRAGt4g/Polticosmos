    "summary": "This bill, the American Artificial Intelligence Leadership and Uniformity Act, aims to establish a national framework to support American leadership in artificial intelligence. It mandates a national AI action plan developed by the President to remove barriers to innovation, set goals, and align federal AI governance with recognized standards. A key provision is a temporary five-year moratorium on state AI laws that restrict AI models and systems engaged in interstate commerce, with specific exceptions to prevent unintended consequences. The bill aims to promote a permissive environment for AI development while the federal government develops guardrails.",
