    "summary": "The App Store Freedom Act aims to regulate app marketplaces. It prohibits unfair practices by companies that control both an app store and its operating system. Key provisions include interoperability requirements (allowing third-party app stores and default settings), open app development (providing developers access to system features), and prohibitions on exclusivity, tying, and interference with developer-user communications. The bill grants enforcement powers to the Federal Trade Commission and allows for state enforcement, while also addressing preemption of state laws. It defines terms like 'covered company' and 'app store' and mandates FTC guidance.",
