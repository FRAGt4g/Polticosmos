    "summary": "This bill, the Information and Communication Technology Strategy Act, mandates the Secretary of Commerce to assess the economic competitiveness of the U.S. information and communication technology (ICT) supply chain. It requires a report identifying critical technologies, evaluating vendor competitiveness, and assessing dependence on untrusted vendors. Based on the report, the Secretary must develop a whole-of-government strategy to bolster trusted ICT vendors, address market barriers, and assign responsibilities. The strategy will include recommendations for strengthening the government's role and associated resource needs. The Secretary will consult with stakeholders and other government agencies.",
