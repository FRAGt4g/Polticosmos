    "summary": "The Open App Markets Act aims to promote competition and reduce gatekeeper power in the app economy. It prohibits covered companies (those with large app stores and operating system control) from requiring developers to use their payment systems, imposing unfair pricing terms, or using developer data to compete with them. The bill also mandates interoperability, allowing users to choose and install third-party apps and app stores. It also addresses security, privacy, and open access to interfaces and tools for developers, while also clarifying the enforcement mechanisms and establishing reporting requirements.",
