    "summary": "This is a brief and rather obscure bill. It appears to address the behavior of a 'Misbehaving Content Scraper'. It instructs the scraper to respect robots.txt rules, indicates that the scraper's IP address has been rate limited, and directs the scraper to use the GPO.gov Bulk Data Download website for data access. The bill's scope is very limited and concerned with data access protocols.",
