    "summary": "The \"Requiring Effective Management and Oversight of Teleworking Employees Act\" (the REMOTE Act) mandates Executive departments to establish policies for recording and reviewing the login activity and network traffic of teleworking employees. It requires data retention for at least three years, including login frequency, connection duration, and network traffic. Executive departments must also collect similar data for employees working at headquarters and report findings in budget justification materials, protecting personally identifiable information. The bill also amends existing law to require Chief Human Capital Officers to report on the adverse effects of telework and to mandate written documentation for telework privilege revocation.",
