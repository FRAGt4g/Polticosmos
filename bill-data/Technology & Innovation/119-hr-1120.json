    "summary": "This bill addresses the actions of a \"Misbehaving Content Scraper.\" It instructs the scraper to respect the robots.txt file, indicates that the scraper's IP address has been rate-limited, and directs the scraper to use the GPO.gov Bulk Data Download website (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/) for data acquisition. The bill appears to be more of a notice/guidance than a substantial legislative proposal, primarily focusing on data access and web scraping practices related to government information.",
