    "summary": "The AV Safety Data Act mandates incident reporting for autonomous vehicles (AVs). It requires manufacturers and operators to submit data to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), including miles traveled, collision information, and details on 'unplanned stoppage events.' The NHTSA will then make this data publicly available. The bill defines key terms like 'covered entity,' 'covered vehicle,' and 'unplanned stoppage event,' and allows for potential amendment or rescission of the regulations after 10 years.",
