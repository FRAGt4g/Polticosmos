    "summary": "The Wireless Resiliency and Flexible Investment Act of 2025 aims to streamline the process for modifying existing wireless facilities. It amends the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 by establishing timelines for State and local governments to approve requests, defines 'eligible facilities requests,' and limits the documentation required. The bill also includes provisions for deemed approval, tolling due to incomplete submissions, and enforcement. The FCC is mandated to issue final rules within 180 days of the act's enactment.",
