    "summary": "This bill, the \"Ensuring National Constitutional Rights for Your Private Telecommunications Act of 2025\" (ENCRYPT Act of 2025), aims to preempt state laws regarding data security and encryption. It prohibits states from mandating or requesting that tech companies design products to allow surveillance or decryption of user data. Additionally, it prevents states from banning products that use encryption. The bill defines \"covered products or services\" and \"online service\" to clarify its scope. The primary goal is to protect user privacy and the development of secure technologies.",
