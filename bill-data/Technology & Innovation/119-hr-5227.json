    "summary": "The 'Unleashing Low-Cost Rural AI Act' mandates the Secretary of Energy to commission a National Laboratory to study the impact of artificial intelligence and data center site growth on US energy supply. The study will assess infrastructure needs, the feasibility of using alternative energy sources (hydroelectric, solar, wind, etc.), impacts on energy costs, and potential deficiencies. It will also explore expediting regulatory reviews and prioritize remote areas. A report must be submitted to relevant congressional committees within 180 days, covering findings and recommendations. The bill defines terms like 'artificial intelligence', 'co-location', 'National Laboratory', and 'remote area'.",
