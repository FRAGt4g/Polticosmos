    "summary": "The Celestial Time Standardization Act mandates NASA to develop a celestial time standardization system, starting with a coordinated lunar time. This initiative aims to support future space operations, infrastructure, and international partnerships. The bill highlights the need for interoperability in deep space exploration, acknowledging the limitations of Coordinated Universal Time beyond Earth. NASA is tasked with leading the study, developing a strategy, coordinating with various federal and private entities, and incorporating key features like traceability to UTC, accuracy, resilience, and scalability. The Administrator of NASA must brief relevant congressional committees within two years on the developed strategy.",
