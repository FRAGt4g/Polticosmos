    "summary": "The \"Lowering Broadband Costs for Consumers Act of 2025\" aims to reduce the financial burden of broadband costs. It mandates the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reform the Universal Service Fund, requiring contributions from both broadband providers and edge providers (online content/service providers). The bill also directs the FCC to establish a new mechanism for supporting eligible telecommunications carriers in high-cost areas. It defines key terms like \"broadband provider\" and \"edge provider\" and outlines enforcement by the FCC via the Communications Act of 1934.",
