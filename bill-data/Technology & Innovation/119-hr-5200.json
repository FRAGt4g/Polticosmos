    "summary": "The Emergency Reporting Act (H.R. 5200) directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue reports after the activation of the Disaster Information Reporting System (DIRS). The bill mandates public hearings, followed by reports detailing the duration and impact of outages related to broadband internet, VoIP, commercial mobile services, and emergency communications failures. It also requires the FCC to investigate and report on improvements to network outage reporting, focusing on providing visual information to public safety agencies and addressing unreported 9-1-1 outages. Finally, the bill defines relevant terms and restricts FCC authority to what is explicitly authorized.",
