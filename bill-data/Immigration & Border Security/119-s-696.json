    "summary": "This bill, the 'Protecting Our Guests During Hostilities in Ukraine Act,' proposes to grant temporary Ukrainian guest status to eligible aliens who were paroled under the Uniting for Ukraine program. This status would be retroactive to the date of their initial parole. Ukrainian guests would be authorized to work in the United States for the duration of their status. The status would expire 120 days after the Secretary of State determines that hostilities in Ukraine have ceased and it is safe for civilians to return. The bill also outlines grounds for revocation of the status.",
