    "summary": "This bill, the \"Deport Alien Gang Members Act,\" amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish new grounds for inadmissibility and deportability for non-citizens associated with criminal gangs. It introduces a legal definition for \"criminal gang\" and creates a formal process for the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate such groups. The act mandates the detention of aliens identified as gang members and makes them ineligible for various forms of immigration relief, including asylum, temporary protected status, and parole, with limited exceptions. The provisions are designed to facilitate the removal and prevent the entry of non-citizen gang members.",
