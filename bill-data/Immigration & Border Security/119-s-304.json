    "summary": "The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2025 seeks to clarify the definition of 'subject to the jurisdiction' in the Immigration and Nationality Act. It amends the Act to state that a person born in the U.S. is considered a citizen at birth if born to a U.S. citizen/national, a lawful permanent resident residing in the U.S., or an alien in lawful service in the armed forces. It aims to clarify who is considered a citizen by birth and clarifies that this amendment does not affect citizenship status of those born before the act's enactment.",
