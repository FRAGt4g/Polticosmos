    "summary": "The Mandatory Removal Proceedings Act, introduced in the Senate, mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security to immediately begin removal proceedings for non-citizens whose visas are revoked for security or related reasons. The bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act, specifically section 221(i), to clarify visa revocation procedures, shift authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and establish a mandatory removal process tied to grounds for removal outlined in section 237(a)(4). It also specifies that there is no judicial review for such actions.",
