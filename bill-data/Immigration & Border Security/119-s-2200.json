    "summary": "The First Responders Emergency Assistance Act (S. 2200) authorizes the Administrator of FEMA to award grants to eligible entities (state, tribal, territorial, and local law enforcement, emergency operations centers, and first responder agencies) to fund costs associated with responding to a rapid increase in the arrival or presence of recent US immigrants. Grants can be used for equipment, personnel costs, and other appropriate activities. The bill mandates geographic distribution, information collection, and reporting to Congress, with a focus on improving operational efficiency and program oversight. Funds cannot be used for the enforcement of federal immigration laws.",
