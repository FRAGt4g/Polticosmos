    "summary": "The SAFER at the Border Act (H.R. 4234) aims to restrict the Secretary of Homeland Security's ability to parole certain aliens into the United States. The bill defines \"known terrorist\" and \"special interest alien,\" and prohibits parole for individuals meeting these criteria, as well as those deemed inadmissible due to criminal or terrorist activities, or those listed on terrorism watchlists. It amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to reflect these changes, with exceptions for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.",
