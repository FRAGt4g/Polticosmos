    "summary": "This bill, the 'Fund and Complete the Border Wall Act,' establishes a 'Secure the Southern Border Fund' in the U.S. Treasury to finance a U.S.-Mexico border barrier. It creates funding streams by imposing a 5% fee on certain international remittances, increasing the Form I-94 fee, and redirecting foreign aid from countries whose citizens are apprehended crossing the border illegally. The bill mandates the design and construction of physical barriers along the southern border by December 31, 2025, and amends overtime pay regulations for U.S. Border Patrol agents under the Fair Labor Standards Act.",
