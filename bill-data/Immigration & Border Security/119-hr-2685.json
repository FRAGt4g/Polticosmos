    "summary": "The 'Crime Doesn't Fly Act of 2025' prohibits the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) from accepting warrants for the arrest or removal of aliens issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as valid identification at aviation security checkpoints. However, this prohibition does not apply to aliens being removed from the United States according to immigration laws. The bill aims to restrict the use of specific ICE forms (I-200 and I-205) for identification purposes at airports.",
