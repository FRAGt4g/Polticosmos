    "summary": "The Border Wall Waste Accountability Act (H.R. 326) directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study on government waste related to border security. The bill requires the Comptroller General to submit a report to Congress within 90 days of the act's passage. This report must detail the total cost of unused construction materials that were acquired for the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border during the period from January 20, 2021, to January 20, 2025. The act aims to quantify and publicize the financial implications of halting the project.",
