    "summary": "The Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act (S. 1151) expands the use of E-Verify, making it mandatory for all U.S. employers, federal contractors, and designated critical employers. It increases penalties for non-compliance, allows for debarment of repeat violators, and introduces information sharing among government agencies to identify unauthorized aliens. The bill also amends the Form I-9 process, establishes an Employer Compliance Inspection Center, and addresses identity theft related to employment.  It aims to strengthen enforcement of immigration laws and hold employers accountable for verifying employee eligibility.",
