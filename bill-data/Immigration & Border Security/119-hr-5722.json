    "summary": "The 'Preserving a Sharia-Free America Act' aims to prevent individuals who adhere to Sharia law from entering the United States. It mandates the denial of immigration benefits, visas, and admission to the U.S. for such individuals. Furthermore, it stipulates the revocation of immigration benefits, visa revocation, inadmissibility, or deportation of aliens found to be adherents of Sharia law within the U.S. The bill also addresses false statements regarding Sharia law adherence and makes departmental determinations non-reviewable by courts.",
