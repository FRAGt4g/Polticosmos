    "summary": "The Student Visa Security Improvement Act aims to enhance national security by tightening the student visa process. It mandates the Department of Homeland Security to conduct more rigorous background checks, including in-person interviews, for F, J, and M visa applicants, with a focus on terrorism risks. The bill also strengthens the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS) by requiring institutions to monitor foreign students more closely, ensuring they are regularly observed and that status changes are reported promptly. It also requires upgrades to the SEVIS system, a review of fees, and biannual reporting to Congress on student compliance.",
