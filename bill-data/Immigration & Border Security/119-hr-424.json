    "summary": "The State Border Security Reimbursement Act of 2025 proposes to reimburse states for expenses related to border security. The bill argues that border security is a federal responsibility and that states like Texas have unfairly borne significant costs. Under the act, any state that has spent over $2.5 billion on border security in the preceding ten years can apply for full reimbursement from the federal government. To qualify, governors must submit a detailed accounting of these expenses. The federal government would then be required to reimburse the state within one year of the application.",
