    "summary": "The \"Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act\" amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to expand the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation. The bill makes non-citizens inadmissible\u2014barring them from entry or legal status\u2014if they have been convicted of, or admit to committing, sex offenses, domestic violence, stalking, child abuse, or violating protection orders. It also adds a conviction for a sex offense as a new ground for deportability, facilitating the removal of individuals who have committed such crimes from the United States.",
