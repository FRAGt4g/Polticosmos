    "summary": "The Constitutional Citizenship Clarification Act of 2025 aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. It seeks to clarify that certain individuals born in the United States are not automatically considered citizens at birth. The bill's intent is to exclude children of those unlawfully present, those with diplomatic immunity, or those engaged in hostile activities, from birthright citizenship. It references the 14th Amendment and the concept of 'jus soli' while articulating exceptions based on allegiance and obedience.",
