    "summary": "The 'End Unaccountable Amnesty Act' primarily focuses on reforming immigration policies. It aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding Temporary Protected Status (TPS), establishing stricter requirements for its designation and extension. The bill also revises the process for repatriating unaccompanied alien children, addresses special immigrant juvenile status, repeals cancellation of removal, and reforms immigration parole. Further, it prohibits the use of certain documents for identification at airport security and restricts air carrier operations that accept these documents. The bill also introduces a cause of action for financial harm resulting from its implementation and dictates implementation timelines.",
