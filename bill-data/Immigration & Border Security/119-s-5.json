    "summary": "The Laken Riley Act mandates the detention of aliens charged with theft and other specified offenses. It amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to broaden the grounds for detention and allows state attorneys general to sue the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of their state if the Secretary's actions (e.g., releasing an alien) harm the state or its residents. The bill also includes provisions related to parole, visa grants, and detention requirements, along with limitations on injunctive relief.",
