    "summary": "The Timely Departure Act mandates that most nonimmigrant aliens seeking entry to the U.S. pay a bond or cash payment, ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. This is to ensure they leave the country before their authorized stay expires. Failure to depart timely results in forfeiture of the bond, immediate removal from the U.S., and a 4-12 year ban on obtaining legal immigration status. The bill also limits asylum and withholding of removal applications for those who don't depart on time. Regulations are specified, and the Secretary of Homeland Security is prohibited from waiving any requirements.",
