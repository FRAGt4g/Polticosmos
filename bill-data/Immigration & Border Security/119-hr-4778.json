    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 4778, is for the relief of Jeanette Vizguerra-Ramirez. It grants her eligibility for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status to permanent residency, notwithstanding certain sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act. If she enters the U.S. before the application deadline, she is considered to have remained lawfully and is eligible for adjustment of status. The application must be filed within two years of the bill's enactment. The Secretary of State must reduce the number of available immigrant visas by one. Additionally, the bill denies preferential immigration treatment to her relatives based solely on their relationship.",
