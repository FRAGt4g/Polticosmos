    "summary": "The Protect DREAMer Confidentiality Act of 2025 aims to protect the privacy of information submitted by individuals applying for deferred action under the DACA program. The bill mandates that the Secretary of Homeland Security safeguards this \"individual application information\" from disclosure to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and state/local/tribal law enforcement, except for DACA program implementation. Referrals to law enforcement are prohibited. Exceptions exist for national security, preventing fraudulent claims, and felony investigations unrelated to immigration status.",
