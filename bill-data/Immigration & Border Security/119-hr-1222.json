    "summary": "The Operation Lone Star Reimbursement Act, introduced in the House of Representatives, aims to reimburse the State of Texas for expenses related to securing the southern border. The bill cites the Federal Government's responsibility for border security and Texas's actions to address what it sees as federal inaction. The bill outlines the application process for reimbursement, requiring the Governor of Texas to submit expenses to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of the Treasury. These expenses would be reviewed, and if approved, the bill would authorize reimbursement to Texas from the Treasury.",
