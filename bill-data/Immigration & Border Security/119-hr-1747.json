    "summary": "The Break the Chain Act amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to significantly alter family-sponsored immigration. It redefines immediate relatives, modifies family-based visa preferences, adjusts how 'aging out' affects immigration eligibility, and creates a new nonimmigrant classification (W) for parents of adult U.S. citizens. This new classification comes with conditions on admission, employment, and public benefits. The bill also includes provisions on affidavit of support and sets an effective date with stipulations on the validity of certain pending petitions and applications, primarily impacting family-based immigration categories.",
