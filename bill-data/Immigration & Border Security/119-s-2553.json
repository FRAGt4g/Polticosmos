    "summary": "The Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. It seeks to classify aliens convicted of or who have committed driving while intoxicated (DUI) offenses as inadmissible to the United States and deportable. The bill specifies that convictions or admissions related to driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, regardless of the offense classification (misdemeanor or felony), will result in these immigration consequences. The legislation would affect both inadmissibility and deportability under U.S. immigration laws.",
