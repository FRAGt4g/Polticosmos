    "summary": "The Alan T. Shao II Fentanyl Public Health Emergency and Overdose Prevention Act aims to address the fentanyl crisis. The bill proposes suspending the entry of 'covered aliens' (those attempting unlawful entry from Canada or Mexico without proper documentation) into the United States.  It cites high death rates from fentanyl overdoses, the drug's potency, and large seizures by law enforcement. The bill mandates the return of these individuals to their country of origin and authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to utilize repatriation flights for this purpose.",
