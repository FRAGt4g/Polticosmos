    "summary": "This bill, the \"Putting Highest Degrees First Act of 2025,\" aims to provide lawful permanent resident status to certain doctoral degree holders. It exempts qualified individuals from numerical limitations on permanent residents, amends relevant sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and allows for 'dual intent' for F nonimmigrant students pursuing doctoral degrees in the U.S. This would enable students with doctoral aspirations to remain in the US for employment without fear.",
