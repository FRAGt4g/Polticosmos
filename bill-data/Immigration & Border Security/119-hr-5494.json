    "summary": "This bill, the Essential Workers for Economic Advancement Act, proposes a new H-2C nonimmigrant visa category for non-agricultural workers. It outlines the requirements for employers to become 'registered employers' and for positions to be designated as 'registered positions.' The bill sets numerical limits on the number of these visas, details application processes, and includes provisions for worker protections, enforcement, and penalties. It also mandates a study on the program's impact, focusing on its effect on the economy, wages, and social services.",
