    "summary": "The Trust Through Transparency Act of 2025 mandates that all immigration enforcement officers wear and operate body cameras during public-facing immigration enforcement actions. It sets guidelines for footage retention, requiring permanent deletion unless the footage captures specific events like use of force, arrests, or complaints. The bill also details disciplinary actions for non-compliance, annual reporting to Congress on enforcement functions, and the establishment of an independent advisory panel to provide recommendations on body camera policies.",
