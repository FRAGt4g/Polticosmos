    "summary": "This bill, the \"Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act of 2025,\" aims to provide a civil remedy for individuals harmed by aliens who benefitted from \"sanctuary policies.\" It defines \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" and allows victims of certain crimes committed by aliens (who were not detained/deported) to sue these jurisdictions for compensatory damages. It also includes provisions concerning the waiver of immunity for states that accept federal grants and outlines cooperation between federal and local law enforcement. The bill's intent is to hold sanctuary jurisdictions accountable for the actions of individuals they may be sheltering from federal immigration enforcement.",
