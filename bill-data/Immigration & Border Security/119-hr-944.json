    "summary": "The Access to Counsel Act aims to clarify and strengthen the rights of individuals held or detained at U.S. ports of entry or facilities overseen by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It mandates that a \"covered individual\" be given a meaningful opportunity to consult with counsel and interested parties during inspections, with specific provisions for access, advocacy, and in-person appearances.  It also addresses the acceptance of abandonment forms from lawful permanent residents. This Act amends the Immigration and Nationality Act and outlines definitions for \"counsel\" and \"covered individual.\"",
