    "summary": "The 'Stop Greenlighting Driver Licenses for Illegal Immigrants Act' restricts federal grants to states that issue driver's licenses to individuals lacking proof of U.S. citizenship or lawful presence, or that restrict sharing immigration enforcement information with the Department of Homeland Security.  Affected states must return unobligated grant funds and become ineligible for future grants until they change their laws or policies to comply. The bill targets the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program.",
