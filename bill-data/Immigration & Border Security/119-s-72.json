    "summary": "The 'Justice for Jocelyn Act' focuses on immigration enforcement. It mandates that aliens on the ICE nondetained docket participate in Alternatives to Detention programs with continuous GPS monitoring, and adhere to a curfew. The bill also amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to order the removal of aliens who fail to comply with release orders. It prioritizes detention until all beds are filled and sets strict standards for release.",
