    "summary": "The Laken Riley Act amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to mandate the detention of non-U.S. citizens who have been arrested for or charged with burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. The bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue a detainer for and take custody of these individuals. It also grants state attorneys general legal standing to sue the federal government in district court for injunctive relief if they fail to enforce various immigration detention and removal provisions, provided the state can demonstrate harm, including financial harm exceeding $100.",
