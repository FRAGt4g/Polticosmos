    "summary": "The Keep STEM Talent Act of 2025 aims to provide a pathway to lawful permanent resident status for foreign nationals holding advanced degrees in STEM fields from U.S. institutions. It mandates enhanced vetting procedures for students, including background checks and interviews, and requires an annual report on the program's effectiveness. The bill also addresses dual intent for F-1 visa holders, allowing them to pursue advanced STEM degrees even if seeking permanent residency. This involves amendments to existing immigration laws regarding visa requirements and labor certifications.",
