    "summary": "The Border Enforcement, Security, and Trade Facilitation Act of 2025 proposes a pilot program within the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This program establishes Image Technician positions (Image Technician 1 and 2) to review non-intrusive inspection images of conveyances and containers entering/exiting the U.S. Their duties include identifying potential contraband and recommending further inspection or release. The bill outlines training, annual assessments, and reporting requirements. The program will be reviewed and will sunset after 5 years, with the individuals holding the positions transferring to other positions after the pilot program ends.",
