    "summary": "The \"Working for Immigrant Safety and Empowerment Act\" (WISE Act) aims to extend immigration benefits to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other gender-based violence. The bill reforms U visa qualifications, eliminates numerical limitations, and provides work authorization. It addresses parole for U visa applicants and prohibits the detention of certain victims. The bill also amends multiple sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide relief and protection for abused immigrants, including provisions for battered spouses and children, and access to services. Additionally, the bill strengthens waivers and exemptions for various categories of vulnerable immigrants, including those seeking adjustment of status.",
