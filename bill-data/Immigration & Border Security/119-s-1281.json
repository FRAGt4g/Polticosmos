    "summary": "The bill, titled the Restoring Industry Development in Entertainment Act (RIDE Act), proposes the creation of a new nonimmigrant visa (P-4) for mobile entertainment workers. The bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to define \"mobile entertainment workers\" and specifies the requirements for this visa, including a Labor Department certification that U.S. workers are unavailable and that the alien's employment won't harm U.S. worker wages/conditions. The bill defines \"mobile entertainment providers\" and mandates rulemaking by the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Labor to implement these changes within specified deadlines.",
