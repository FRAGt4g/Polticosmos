    "summary": "The 'Ban Birth Tourism Act' amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to prevent aliens from obtaining U.S. citizenship for their children by giving birth in the United States. It specifies that any nonimmigrant seeking entry for the primary purpose of securing citizenship for a child born in the U.S. is inadmissible, with an exception for those seeking legitimate medical treatment related to childbirth. The bill seeks to curb 'birth tourism'.",
