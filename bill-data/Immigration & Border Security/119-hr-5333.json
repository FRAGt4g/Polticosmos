    "summary": "This bill, the 9/11 Immigrant Worker Freedom Act, aims to allow certain non-citizen workers who provided rescue, recovery, demolition, cleanup, or related services after the September 11th terrorist attacks to apply for lawful permanent resident status. It specifies eligibility criteria based on location/duration of service, provides work authorization during the application process, and outlines fee waivers based on financial hardship. The bill also includes confidentiality provisions and states that the granting of permanent residency under this act will not reduce the number of immigrant visas available.",
