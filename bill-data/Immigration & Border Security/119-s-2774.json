    "summary": "This bill, the \"Stop Greenlighting Driver Licenses for Illegal Immigrants Act of 2025,\" aims to restrict federal grants (specifically Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program funds) to states that issue driver's licenses to individuals without proof of U.S. citizenship or lawful presence. It also penalizes states that hinder the sharing of immigration enforcement information with the Department of Homeland Security.  The bill outlines definitions for key terms like \"immigration enforcement information\" and details penalties, including returning grant funds and ineligibility for future grants until compliant policies are enacted.",
