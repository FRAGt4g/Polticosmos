    "summary": "The Law Enforcement Solidarity Act (H.R. 3081) aims to restrict federal funding to jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal law enforcement. Specifically, it would deem jurisdictions with \"law enforcement cooperation restrictions\" ineligible for federal funds intended to benefit undocumented immigrants. The Attorney General is mandated to report annually on jurisdictions with such restrictions. The bill defines \"jurisdiction with law enforcement cooperation restrictions\" and references definitions from existing legal statutes, including the terms \"alien\" and \"Federal law enforcement officer.\"",
