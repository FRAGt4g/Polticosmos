    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 1445, aims to provide relief to Ruslana Melnyk and Mykhaylo Gnatyuk. It grants them eligibility for permanent resident status in the United States, allowing them to apply for an immigrant visa or adjust their status to lawful permanent residence. The bill outlines the conditions for application, including a two-year deadline for filing and fee payment. Upon granting permanent residence, the Secretary of State will reduce the number of immigrant visas available to natives of their birth country. Additionally, the bill prevents their immediate family members (parents, siblings) from receiving preferential immigration treatment.",
