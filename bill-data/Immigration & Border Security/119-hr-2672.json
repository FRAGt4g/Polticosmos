    "summary": "The Religious Workforce Protection Act aims to assist religious workers experiencing delays in obtaining permanent residency. It allows for extensions of nonimmigrant status (R visa) for those with pending immigrant visa applications, exempting them from numerical limitations. It provides job flexibility and waives the 1-year foreign residence requirement for certain religious workers who had to leave the U.S. due to the initial R visa limitations.",
