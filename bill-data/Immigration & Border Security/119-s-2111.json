    "summary": "The American Students First Act of 2025 aims to limit the number of foreign students enrolled in U.S. universities. It mandates that universities participating in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program limit the enrollment of nonimmigrant students (F and M visas) to 10% of their student population. The President or the Secretary of Homeland Security can waive this cap for national security or U.S. interests, allowing up to 15% enrollment in such cases.",
