    "summary": "The 'Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement Act of 2025' mandates that immigration enforcement officers display visible identification during public-facing actions. The bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to define 'covered immigration officer' and 'public immigration enforcement function.' It specifies the required identification details (agency, name/badge number) and format (legibility at 25 feet). Non-compliance results in administrative discipline. The Secretary of Homeland Security must submit annual reports to Congress detailing enforcement actions and non-compliance, and the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will handle complaints and issue recommendations.",
