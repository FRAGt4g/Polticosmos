    "summary": "The \"Protect Our Law enforcement with Immigration Control and Enforcement Act of 2025\" (POLICE Act) amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make assaulting a law enforcement officer a deportable offense. An alien can be deported if they are convicted of, or admit to committing, an assault against a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responder. The offense is deportable if the official was targeted during their duties, because of their duties, or due to their status. The bill also requires the Department of Homeland Security to publish an annual report on the number of aliens deported under this new rule.",
