    "summary": "The Guam Temporary Workforce Act allows the Governor of Guam to determine the temporary need for nonimmigrant (H-2B) workers.  Employers seeking to hire H-2B workers for Guam must first obtain temporary labor certification from the Governor of Guam. The Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) will then approve employer petitions if the Governor's certification is approved and addresses criteria such as worker availability and impact on existing wages. The bill defines terms, referencing DHS regulations with modifications, and outlines grounds for invalidating the Governor's certification.",
