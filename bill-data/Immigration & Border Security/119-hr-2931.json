    "summary": "The 'Save SBA from Sanctuary Cities Act' directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to relocate SBA offices located in sanctuary jurisdictions. It defines sanctuary jurisdictions as those that restrict information sharing or cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The bill mandates relocation outside of sanctuary jurisdictions within 60 days of a determination and details consequences for non-compliance, including office closure and employee reassignment. It also prevents the SBA from establishing new offices in sanctuary jurisdictions.",
