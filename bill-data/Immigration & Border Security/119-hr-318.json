    "summary": "The Border Safety and Security Act of 2025 grants the Secretary of Homeland Security new powers to manage the U.S. border. It provides discretionary authority to suspend the entry of certain aliens at land or sea borders if deemed necessary to achieve \"operational control.\" The bill also mandates this suspension if the Department of Homeland Security cannot detain these individuals or place them in alternative programs as required by law. Uniquely, it empowers state attorneys general to sue the federal government in court to enforce this mandatory suspension provision.",
