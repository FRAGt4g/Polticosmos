    "summary": "This bill, the \"Stopping Border Surges Act,\" aims to curtail illegal immigration by overhauling rules for unaccompanied children and asylum seekers. It facilitates the quicker repatriation of all unaccompanied minors and allows for indefinite family detention by superseding the Flores settlement. The bill significantly restricts asylum by raising the 'credible fear' standard, barring applicants who transited through safe third countries without seeking protection, shortening application deadlines, and increasing penalties. It also restricts asylum claims to official ports of entry and lengthens the wait for work permits, aiming to close perceived loopholes in immigration law.",
