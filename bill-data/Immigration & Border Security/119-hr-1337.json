    "summary": "This bill, HR 1337, proposes to add Ireland to the E3 nonimmigrant visa program. It amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include Irish nationals for E3 visas, clarifies employer requirements, and establishes an application allocation system. The bill specifies that Irish nationals applying for these visas will be capped by the difference between the prior year's Australian visa approvals and 10,500. It also mandates that participating employers are enrolled in the E-Verify program.",
