    "summary": "The 'ICE Security Reform Act of 2025' proposes significant changes to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). It mandates the separation of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) from ICE, establishing HSI as a distinct entity within the Department of Homeland Security, with a President-appointed Director. ICE itself would be renamed U.S. Immigration Compliance Enforcement, also under a President-appointed Director. The bill includes provisions for investigative guidelines, reviews, reports, savings clauses, and asset transfers, clarifying procedural and operational details for the transition. This is all laid out in the interest of public safety and transparency.",
