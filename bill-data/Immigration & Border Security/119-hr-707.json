    "summary": "This bill, the Deport Illegal Voters Act of 2025, aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. It seeks to classify unlawful voting as an \"aggravated felony,\" leading to stricter consequences for non-citizens who vote illegally. The bill modifies the definition of aggravated felonies and makes those who violate voting laws inadmissible to the US and potentially subject to deportation.",
