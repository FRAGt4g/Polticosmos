    "summary": "The Immigration Parole Reform Act of 2025 amends Section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It restricts the Secretary of Homeland Security's ability to grant parole, defining specific circumstances for urgent humanitarian reasons (medical emergencies, family deaths, organ donation, etc.) and significant public benefit (assistance in law enforcement). The bill emphasizes case-by-case review and limits parole duration. It also includes reporting requirements and clarifies employment authorization for certain parolees. Any person, state, or local government that incurs financial harm in excess of $1,000 due to a failure in applying the provisions of the act has standing to sue the Federal Government.",
