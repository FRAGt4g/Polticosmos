    "summary": "This bill, the Stop Unlawful Detention and End Mistreatment Act of 2025 (H.R. 4078), mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a publicly accessible, online database. This database will contain information about individuals detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including legal authority, detention duration, location (with exceptions), demographic data, disciplinary actions, and deportations. It also covers non-traditional detention locations, requiring detailed information about facilities under the Department of Defense, on Indian lands, or outside the continental U.S. Finally, the bill prohibits discontinuing or reducing the operation of the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman or the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of the Department of Homeland Security.",
