    "summary": "The Shadow Wolves Improvement Act aims to enhance the effectiveness of the Shadow Wolves Program within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The bill focuses on clarifying the program's mission and goals, determining staffing needs, updating the program's strategy, providing information to officers considering reclassification, developing a succession plan for vacant positions, and establishing criteria for expansion of the program to additional tribal lands. It also mandates a report to Congress on the progress of implementation and amends existing law to allow experienced Shadow Wolves to transition to career appointments.",
