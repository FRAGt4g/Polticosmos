    "summary": "This bill, the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge Act, proposes to rename the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in Texas to the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge. The bill cites the murder of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray and mentions two alleged illegal aliens charged with the crime. It also references a prior executive order by President Trump on the same topic. The bill emphasizes the victim's love for animals and deems the renaming fitting given the refuge's proximity to her hometown.",
