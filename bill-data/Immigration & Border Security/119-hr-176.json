    "summary": "This bill, the \"No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act,\" amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make any alien who participated in, planned, financed, supported, or facilitated the Hamas-led attacks against Israel starting on October 7, 2023, inadmissible to the United States. It also makes these individuals ineligible for any form of immigration relief, such as asylum, and subject to deportation. The bill explicitly adds Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad to the list of terrorist organizations. It further requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit an annual report to Congress on the number of individuals impacted by these provisions.",
