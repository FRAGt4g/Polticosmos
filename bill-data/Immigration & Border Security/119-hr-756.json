    "summary": "The '287(g) Program Protection Act' amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to clarify and expand the 287(g) program, which allows state and local law enforcement to assist in immigration enforcement. It mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security to enter into agreements with state and local entities upon request, outlining specific enforcement models and prohibiting program termination absent compelling reasons. The bill also requires uniform training, annual performance reports, and an annual recruitment plan for the program. Funding for the program is also affected by this bill.",
