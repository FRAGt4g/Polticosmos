    "summary": "The \"Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2025\" aims to establish a visa waiver program for the U.S. Virgin Islands, adding it to an existing program for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. It would allow nonimmigrant visitors for business or pleasure from designated countries, particularly Caribbean Community nations, to enter and stay in the Virgin Islands for up to 45 days without a visa. The Secretary of Homeland Security would implement the program after ensuring it poses no security threat and that an adequate entry/exit system is in place. An administrative fee will cover program costs.",
