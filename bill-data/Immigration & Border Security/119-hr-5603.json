    "summary": "The Emergency Responder Protection Act aims to limit the authority of immigration officers at protected emergency response locations. It restricts enforcement actions within 1,000 feet of such locations, except under exigent circumstances, and mandates specific protocols for actions that do occur. The bill defines \"protected emergency response location\" broadly and requires reporting and training for relevant officials. It also outlines consequences for violations and requires reports to Congress. The overall goal is to ensure that vulnerable individuals seeking aid at emergency locations are not deterred by fear of immigration enforcement.",
