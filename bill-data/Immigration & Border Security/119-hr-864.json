    "summary": "The Freedom to Cooperate Act aims to clarify the federal government's jurisdiction over immigration law and policy. It seeks to prevent states from hindering federal immigration enforcement efforts, particularly concerning sanctuary policies. The bill amends existing law to allow local law enforcement to fully cooperate with federal officials and clarifies the process for issuing and complying with ICE detainers, including provisions for transfer of custody and immunity for entities complying with detainers. It also includes the stipulation that law enforcement officials are not required to report or arrest victims or witnesses of a criminal offense.",
