    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 273, the 'REMAIN in Mexico Act of 2025,' directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to implement the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). This policy, also known as 'Remain in Mexico,' requires certain asylum seekers arriving at the U.S. southern border to wait in Mexico while their U.S. immigration cases are pending. The bill mandates that the MPP must be implemented according to a specific January 2019 memorandum from then-Secretary Nielsen. This directive is to be enforced 'notwithstanding any other provision of law,' making the reinstatement of the policy mandatory.",
