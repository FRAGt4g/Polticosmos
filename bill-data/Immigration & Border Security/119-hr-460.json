    "summary": "This bill, the \"Chinese Communist Party Visa Disclosure Act of 2025,\" requires applicants for student (F), vocational (M), and exchange visitor (J) visas to disclose any funding received from the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), or their controlled entities. The bill mandates updates to relevant visa forms to collect this information, including the amount and source of funds. It also establishes a continuous reporting requirement for current visa holders, with failure to disclose resulting in potential visa revocation. The rules apply to the visa holders as well as their spouses and minor children.",
