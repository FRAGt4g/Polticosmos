    "summary": "The Canadian Snowbird Act aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow Canadian retirees to stay in the United States as long-term visitors for pleasure (under section 101(a)(15)(B)).  These retirees must meet specific criteria, including being Canadian citizens at least 50 years old, maintaining Canadian residency, owning or renting U.S. accommodations, and not engaging in unauthorized employment or seeking public assistance. The act also addresses tax status for these visitors and limits their US stay to a maximum of 240 days per year.",
