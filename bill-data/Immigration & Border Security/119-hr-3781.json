    "summary": "The Visa Overstays Penalties Act aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. It introduces increased penalties for visa overstays and illegal presence in the United States. This includes fines, imprisonment, and civil penalties for non-immigrants who fail to maintain their visa status or violate its conditions. Penalties escalate for repeat offenses and prior convictions under subsection (a). The bill defines visa overstay violations, specifying a 10-day threshold for violations, and outlines penalties dependent on the scope and number of violations.",
