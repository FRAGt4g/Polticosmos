    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 5340, prohibits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from disclosing records of individuals for immigration enforcement purposes. It explicitly protects records maintained by HUD and public housing agencies. It mandates a report to Congress detailing compliance, record security, past sharing practices, and future compliance measures. The bill defines key terms like 'immigration enforcement,' 'agency,' 'public housing agency,' 'record,' and 'system of records,' ensuring records cannot be disclosed regardless of an individual's immigration status, except with their consent.",
