    "summary": "The Security First Act aims to enhance border security by authorizing $110 million annually from FY2025-2028 for the Operation Stonegarden grant program. It establishes a trust fund for this program, financed by undeclared currency seized at the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill requires the Secretary of State to assess whether specific Mexican cartels and the Tren de Aragua gang meet the criteria for designation as Foreign Terrorist Organizations. It also mandates the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a comprehensive technology needs analysis for the Southwest border and report on its recent hiring practices.",
