    "summary": "This bill, known as Grant\u2019s Law, amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the mandatory detention of any alien unlawfully present in the United States who is arrested for certain criminal offenses. These offenses are those that would render the alien inadmissible or deportable if convicted. The legislation stipulates that if the alien is not convicted, the Secretary of Homeland Security must continue to detain them until removal proceedings are completed. It also mandates that these removal proceedings must be concluded within 90 days of the alien's initial detention.",
