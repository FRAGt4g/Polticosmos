    "summary": "This bill proposes to rename the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in Texas to the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge. The bill cites the brutal murder of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray in Houston, Texas, allegedly by illegal aliens, as the primary justification. The bill highlights her love for animals and argues the renaming is fitting. The bill also references a previous Executive Order by President Trump on the same issue. The renaming aims to honor Nungaray and commemorate her life.",
