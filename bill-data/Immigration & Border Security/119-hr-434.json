    "summary": "The \"CBP Workload Staffing Model Act\" directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to develop and implement data-driven workload staffing models for the U.S. Border Patrol and Air and Marine Operations within one year. The bill amends the Homeland Security Act to require these models to account for factors like frontline activities, infrastructure, and technology. It also mandates a new workforce tracking system, annual progress reports to Congress, and a review of the models by the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General to ensure CBP has adequate resources to fulfill its duties effectively.",
