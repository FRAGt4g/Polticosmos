    "summary": "The \"Justice for Jocelyn Act\" proposes stricter controls on non-detained aliens. It mandates that Alternatives to Detention (ATD) programs can only be used when all physical detention facilities are full. The bill requires all aliens on the non-detained docket to be enrolled in ATD with continuous GPS monitoring and a nightly curfew (10 p.m. to 5 a.m.). It also amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow for an immediate \"in absentia\" removal order against any alien who fails to comply with a condition of their release, based on an officer's affidavit.",
