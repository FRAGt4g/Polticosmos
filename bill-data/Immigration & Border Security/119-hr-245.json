    "summary": "The 'Grant Integrity and Border Security Act' requires any applicant for a federal grant to certify they have not violated, are not currently violating, and will not violate laws against bringing in and harboring certain aliens (section 274(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act). The certification covers the previous 10 years and the duration of the grant. The bill authorizes federal agency heads to withhold funds from grantees found to be in violation. This determination can be based on information from Homeland Security, employee convictions, or other credible sources. It also requires the Attorney General to report related violations.",
