    "summary": "The Sanctuary City Accountability Act aims to authorize private citizens to sue sanctuary jurisdictions where an alien commits a crime against them or their family. It defines a sanctuary jurisdiction as a state or local government obstructing immigration enforcement efforts. The bill allows for injunctive relief and compensatory damages and includes limitations on liability for local governments following state policies. It specifies several actions that constitute obstruction, such as refusing to cooperate with ICE detainers or impeding communication with federal immigration officers.",
