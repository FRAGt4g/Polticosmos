It mandates that covered individuals, including U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and visa holders, have a meaningful opportunity to consult with counsel and interested parties, including by phone and in person. It also provides a special rule for lawful permanent residents regarding the abandonment of their status and details definitions for 'counsel' and 'covered individual'. It will take effect 180 days after enactment.",
