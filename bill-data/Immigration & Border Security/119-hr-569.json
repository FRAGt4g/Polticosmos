    "summary": "This bill, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2025, aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. It clarifies the definition of 'subject to the jurisdiction' in the context of birthright citizenship, specifying that a person born in the U.S. qualifies for citizenship if born to a U.S. citizen/national, a lawful permanent resident residing in the U.S., or an alien with lawful status serving in the armed forces. The amendment clarifies but does not change the status of those born before the act's enactment.",
