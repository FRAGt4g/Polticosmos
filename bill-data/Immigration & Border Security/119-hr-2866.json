    "summary": "The 'No Visas for Anti-Semitic Students Act' directs the Secretary of State to revoke or deny visas for students who engage in antisemitic activities. It defines antisemitism based on the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition and specifies 'prohibited antisemitic conduct' as acts of violence, vandalism, or harassment targeting Jewish individuals or institutions, or providing material support for such acts. The bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to reflect these provisions.",
