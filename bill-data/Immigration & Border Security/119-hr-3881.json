    "summary": "The 'Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act' aims to ensure state and local law enforcement cooperate with federal officials regarding undocumented immigrants, especially violent criminals and suspected terrorists. It defines sanctuary jurisdictions as those limiting information sharing with federal authorities on immigration status or compliance with detainers. The bill allows state and local officers to act as federal agents in detainer compliance, with legal protections, but prohibits funds for sanctuary jurisdictions from Economic Development Administration grants and Community Development Block Grants.",
