    "summary": "The 'New Illegal Deduction Elimination Act' (New IDEA Act) aims to prevent businesses from deducting wages paid to unauthorized aliens from their gross income for tax purposes. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to clarify this and establishes a six-year statute of limitations for assessing taxes when this deduction is improperly claimed. The bill also modifies the E-Verify program, making it permanent and expanding its application. It also facilitates information sharing between government agencies regarding unauthorized aliens and allows certain employer practices regarding E-Verify.",
