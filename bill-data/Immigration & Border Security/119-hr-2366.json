    "summary": "The American Families United Act amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to promote family unity. It grants the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security discretionary authority to assist certain spouses and children of U.S. citizens facing removal or seeking immigration benefits. This includes waiving grounds of inadmissibility, terminating removal proceedings, and allowing reapplication for admission. This discretion can be exercised if removal would cause hardship to a U.S. citizen family member, with a presumption of hardship in cases of family separation. The bill also addresses motions to reopen or reconsider denied petitions and orders.",
