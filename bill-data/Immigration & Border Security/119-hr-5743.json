    "summary": "This bill, the \"One Citizen, One Seat Act,\" mandates the Secretary of Commerce to revise the 2020 decennial census tabulation to include only U.S. citizens. This revised population data would then be provided to each state. Furthermore, a state must use only the revised citizen-only population data for all purposes, including federal grant eligibility, if they want to get federal awards. The bill's intent is to alter how population data is used for various government functions.",
