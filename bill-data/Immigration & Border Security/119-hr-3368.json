    "summary": "The 'Born in the USA Act of 2025' aims to prohibit the use of federal funds to carry out Executive Order 14160, which sought to restrict birthright citizenship.  The bill cites the 14th Amendment and the Supreme Court case *United States v. Wong Kim Ark* to defend birthright citizenship, arguing the executive order is unconstitutional. It asserts that birthright citizenship cannot be rescinded by executive order or by an act of Congress.",
