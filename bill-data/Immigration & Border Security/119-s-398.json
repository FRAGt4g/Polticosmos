    "summary": "This bill, the \"National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act\" (NO BAN Act), aims to restrict the President's authority to suspend or restrict the entry of nonimmigrants into the United States based on national origin. It amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to expand nondiscrimination provisions to include religion and further limits the President's power to issue entry restrictions. The bill mandates congressional notification, reporting, and judicial review related to any such restrictions. It also requires reports on the implementation of prior Executive Orders and Proclamations related to travel restrictions, with detailed visa applicant data.",
