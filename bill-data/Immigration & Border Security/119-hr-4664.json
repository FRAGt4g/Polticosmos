    "summary": "The Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act aims to protect pregnant and postpartum noncitizens detained by the Department of Homeland Security. It mandates pregnancy testing, establishes a presumption of release, and limits detention to specific, exceptional circumstances. The bill prohibits the use of restraints except in extraordinary situations, emphasizes humane treatment, and ensures access to essential healthcare services. It also requires training for DHS employees, regular reporting on detention practices, and the adoption of regulations to implement the act's provisions.",
