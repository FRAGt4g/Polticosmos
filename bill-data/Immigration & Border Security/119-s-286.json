    "summary": "The Stop Human Trafficking of Unaccompanied Migrant Children Act of 2025 aims to enhance vetting procedures for sponsors of unaccompanied alien children. It mandates fingerprint background checks, public record checks, and other screenings for sponsors and adult household members. The bill restricts placements with undocumented immigrants (with exceptions for parents/guardians), requires pre- and post-release home visits, and mandates retroactive vetting of existing sponsors. It also requires the Departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security to submit monthly reports detailing various aspects of the program, including the number of children in custody, background checks, and missing child reports.",
