    "summary": "The 'Combating Law Enforcement Anonymity by Requiring Identification Disclosure Act' (CLEAR ID Act) aims to limit the use of federal funds by the Department of Homeland Security for civil immigration enforcement activities unless officers are clearly identifiable. It mandates that officers not wear masks or facial coverings that hide their identity. Officers must verbally and visibly identify themselves and their agency. Exceptions are made for medical necessity or undercover operations meeting specific criteria. The bill highlights findings regarding impersonation of immigration officers and related incidents.",
