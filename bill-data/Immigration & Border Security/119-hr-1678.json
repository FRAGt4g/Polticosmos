    "summary": "The Homeland Security Improvement Act aims to increase transparency, accountability, and community engagement within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It establishes a Border Oversight Commission, an Office of the Ombudsman for Border and Immigration-Related Concerns, and mandates training and continuing education for CBP agents. The bill also addresses data collection on stops and searches, requires reports on migrant deaths, use of force, and body-worn cameras, and limits family separations. Various reports and assessments are required related to border enforcement, technology, and operations, as well as the feasibility of an alternative immigration court system.",
