    "summary": "The Nuclear Family Priority Act aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. It redefines \"immediate relatives\" to include only spouses and children, changes family-sponsored immigrant categories to prioritize spouses and children of permanent residents, and modifies the worldwide level of family-sponsored immigrants. The bill also introduces a nonimmigrant visa (W visa) for parents of adult U.S. citizens but restricts their ability to work, access public benefits, and requires their U.S. citizen child to provide financial support and health insurance. Several sections of the bill affect how the law treats non-citizen family members.",
