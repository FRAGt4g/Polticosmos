    "summary": "The 'End Child Trafficking Now Act' aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. It mandates DNA testing to verify familial relationships between adults and accompanying minors seeking entry into the United States.  It also criminalizes the 'recycling' of minors, defined as using a minor to repeatedly enter the US when the adult is not their relative or guardian, with penalties including fines and imprisonment.  The bill grants immigration officers the power of arrest if they believe a crime is being facilitated.",
