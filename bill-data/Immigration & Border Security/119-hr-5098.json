    "summary": "The Strengthening Our Workforce Act of 2025 proposes to provide conditional lawful permanent residency to certain aliens who meet specific criteria. Eligibility hinges on factors such as presence in the U.S. before January 1, 2024, continuous presence since then, cumulative employment in covered professions, and absence of inadmissibility grounds. Covered professions encompass various sectors, including healthcare, education, sanitation, and construction. Successful applicants receive conditional permanent residency for two years, and then, if requirements are met, are adjusted to a lawful permanent resident status. Waivers of inadmissibility are available in some cases and those granted permanent residency are not subject to the worldwide levels or numerical limitations of section 201(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.",
