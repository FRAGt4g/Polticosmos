    "summary": "The Ukrainian Adjustment Act of 2025 provides a pathway to lawful permanent resident status for eligible Ukrainian nationals. It outlines eligibility criteria, including parole into the U.S. after February 20, 2014, and compliance with vetting requirements. The bill addresses waivers for inadmissibility grounds, protection for battered spouses, and administrative review procedures. It prohibits fees for applications and employment authorization and exempts beneficiaries from numerical limitations. It also amends the definition of \"VAWA self petitioners\". The act also mandates the Department of Homeland Security to issue guidance and implement the act.",
