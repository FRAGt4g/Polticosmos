    "summary": "The Reimbursing Border Communities Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide grants to border communities within 200 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. These grants aim to reimburse communities for expenses related to security measures, including additional wages for law enforcement.  Grants are capped at $500,000 per fiscal year and cannot be used for certain purposes, such as funding legal representation or providing resources to aliens. The Secretary must submit annual reports on grant usage, and $25 million is authorized for appropriations each year from 2026-2036. Sanctuary jurisdictions are ineligible.",
