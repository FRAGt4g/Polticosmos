    "summary": "The EMBER Act aims to mitigate environmental damage and wildfires along the U.S.-Mexico border, primarily caused by illegal immigration. The bill establishes the Southern Border Fuels Management Initiative to reduce wildfire risk through vegetation management, including fuel breaks and invasive species control. It also mandates policies and protocols to prevent environmental degradation and wildfires ignited by individuals without legal immigration status, requiring reports to Congress on incidents and necessary resources. The bill authorizes appropriations for the initiative and includes provisions for reporting by the Comptroller General.",
