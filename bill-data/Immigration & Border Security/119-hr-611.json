    "summary": "The 'Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act of 2025' proposes a civil remedy for individuals harmed by aliens who benefitted from 'sanctuary policies'. It defines key terms like 'sanctuary jurisdiction' and 'sanctuary policy'. The bill allows victims of specific crimes committed by aliens (convicted of a felony with at least a 1-year sentence) to sue sanctuary jurisdictions that failed to cooperate with federal immigration detainers. It also includes provisions on waiving immunity for states receiving certain federal grants and ensures cooperation between federal and local law enforcement. Essentially it aims to hold sanctuary jurisdictions accountable for actions related to illegal immigration.",
