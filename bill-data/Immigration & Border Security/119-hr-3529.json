    "summary": "The Protect Patriot Parents Act (H.R. 3529) addresses the immigration status of parents of U.S. citizens who are or were serving in the military. It allows for the adjustment of status for certain military parents, potentially waiving some grounds for inadmissibility and allowing for the return of parents who were previously removed or voluntarily departed the U.S. It also creates a program for temporary nonimmigrant admission for eligible parents with pending applications to allow them to reunite with their U.S. citizen children.",
