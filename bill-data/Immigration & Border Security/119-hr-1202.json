    "summary": "The 'Stop Human Trafficking of Unaccompanied Migrant Children Act of 2025' mandates stricter vetting procedures for sponsors of unaccompanied alien children. This includes background checks on sponsors and household members, limitations on placement with undocumented immigrants (unless they are a biological parent, legal guardian, or relative of the child), and both pre- and post-release home visits. The bill also requires monthly reports to Congress on the number of children in custody and released, as well as efforts to locate missing children.",
