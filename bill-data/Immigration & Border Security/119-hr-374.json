    "summary": "The \"Diverting IRS Resources to the Exigent Crisis Today Act\" (DIRECT Act) proposes to rescind unobligated funds previously allocated to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for enforcement purposes under the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill redirects the rescinded amount to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The new appropriation is specifically designated for funding the salaries and expenses of new agents and officers hired to enhance security at the southern border of the United States, effectively reallocating federal funds from tax enforcement to border security.",
