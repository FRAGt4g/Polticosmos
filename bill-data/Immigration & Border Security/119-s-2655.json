    "summary": "The Community-based Refugee Reception Act of 2025 aims to establish a program within the United States Refugee Admissions Program. It allows community sponsorship groups to provide initial resettlement services to refugees, including housing, food, and assistance with accessing essential services. The bill outlines eligibility criteria for community sponsorship groups, mandates training, and details reporting to state and local governments. It emphasizes that community-based reception complements existing resettlement pathways and does not replace federally funded services.",
