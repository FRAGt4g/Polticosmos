    "summary": "The \"Ending Catch and Release Act of 2025\" amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to prevent the parole or release of asylum applicants into the United States. It requires that these individuals either be detained or, if arriving by land from a contiguous country, be returned to that territory while their asylum application is considered. The bill also increases the standard for credible fear claims, requiring it to be \"more likely than not\" that the applicant can establish eligibility for asylum. The primary goal is to end the practice of releasing asylum seekers into the U.S. pending their legal proceedings.",
