    "summary": "The Border Airport Fairness Act of 2025 mandates the President to designate specific airports near the U.S. northern and southern borders as ports of entry. These airports must be primary airports within 30 miles of the border and associated with a land border crossing or seaport meeting U.S. Customs and Border Protection criteria. The bill also terminates user fees for these airports. The goal is to streamline customs processes and potentially boost economic activity related to cross-border trade.",
