    "summary": "The 'Creating Obstructions Necessary To Address Illegal and Nefarious Entry Rapidly Act' (CONTAINER Act) aims to authorize certain states to place temporary, movable structures on federal land along the U.S. borders (northern and southern) to enhance border security.  The bill defines key terms, specifies a 45-day notice period for states, and allows the structures to be in place for up to a year, with possible extensions based on consultation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The bill explicitly references the Secure Fence Act of 2006 regarding 'operational control'.",
