    "summary": "Sarah's Law mandates U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take into custody certain non-citizen aliens charged with a crime resulting in death or serious bodily injury. It amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include those inadmissible or deportable under specific sections, as well as those charged with offenses causing death or serious injury. The bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to notify victims (or their families) of such aliens about the alien's status and any efforts to remove them. It also mandates the issuance of a detainer for these aliens.",
