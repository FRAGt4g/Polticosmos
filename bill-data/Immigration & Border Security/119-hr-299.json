    "summary": "The \"Transparency of Migration Act\" (H.R. 299) mandates that the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services publicly report data on their websites about individuals unlawfully present in the U.S. who are processed by their agencies. The bill requires weekly updates on the daily number of these individuals, their countries of origin, age, gender, and any criminal convictions. It also requires reporting on the states to which these individuals have been released or sent, aiming to increase public transparency on migration and border processing.",
