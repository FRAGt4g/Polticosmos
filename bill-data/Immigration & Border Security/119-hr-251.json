    "summary": "The Legal Workforce Act amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to mandate the use of an electronic employment eligibility verification system for all U.S. employers, phasing out the voluntary E-Verify program. The bill establishes a phased implementation based on employer size, with special timelines for agricultural workers. It requires employers to verify new hires and reverify those with limited work authorization. The legislation details the system's design, sets new civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, provides a \"good faith\" defense for employers, and includes measures to combat identity fraud and protect worker privacy.",
