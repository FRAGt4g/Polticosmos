    "summary": "The Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act aims to ensure cooperation between federal, state, and local law enforcement regarding individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. It defines 'sanctuary jurisdiction,' and the bill seeks to penalize such jurisdictions by making them ineligible for certain federal funds, including those for economic development and community development block grants. It also outlines legal protections for state and local officials who comply with federal detainers and allows for the substitution of the U.S. as the defendant in relevant legal proceedings. The Act has an effective date of October 1, 2025.",
