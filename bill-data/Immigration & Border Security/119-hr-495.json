    "summary": "The Subterranean Border Defense Act (H.R. 495) is a bipartisan bill that amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023. Its core function is to mandate annual reports on the strategic plan for countering illicit cross-border tunnels. Previously, the law only required the initial development of this plan. By instituting an annual reporting requirement, the bill aims to increase transparency and ensure continuous, updated efforts by the government to secure the border against the threat of illegal subterranean passages used for smuggling and other illicit activities.",
