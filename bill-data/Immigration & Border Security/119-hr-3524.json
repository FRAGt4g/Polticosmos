    "summary": "The Protect Patriot Spouses Act aims to adjust the immigration status of certain military spouses. It amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow for adjustment of status for spouses of U.S. citizens who are or were in the Armed Forces, waiving certain inadmissibility grounds. The bill also addresses the eligibility of previously removed or voluntarily departed aliens, allowing them to apply for immigrant visas and potentially enter the U.S. as nonimmigrants while their applications are pending.",
