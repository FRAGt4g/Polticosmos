    "summary": "Sarah's Law mandates the detention of certain non-citizen aliens charged with crimes resulting in death or serious bodily injury, focusing on those who were not inspected and admitted, had revoked visas, or are described under specific criteria. It amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include this detention. The bill also requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to notify victims or their families about the alien's information, including immigration status and criminal history, and any custody changes or removal efforts. This aims to provide information to crime victims and relatives.",
