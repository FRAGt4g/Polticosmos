    "summary": "The Justice for Angel Families Act proposes to authorize grants for crime victims, specifically focusing on \"angel families\" (immediate family members of victims of homicides committed by certain categories of undocumented aliens). It amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to include angel families in compensation programs.  Additionally, the bill mandates the establishment of a Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office within the Department of Homeland Security to provide services and support to victims of crimes committed by inadmissible or unlawfully present aliens.",
