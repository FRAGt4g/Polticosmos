    "summary": "This bill, the \"Help Ensure Legal Detainers Act,\" aims to deny federal funding to any state or local government that hinders state or local law enforcement officials from cooperating with the Secretary of Homeland Security on immigration detainers. Specifically, it targets jurisdictions that prevent timely responses to information requests about detained aliens or that don't hold aliens for up to 48 hours after receiving an immigration detainer, allowing the Secretary to assume custody. The bill includes provisions for political subdivisions within ineligible states to apply for direct federal funds.",
