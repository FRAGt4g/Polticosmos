    "summary": "The \"No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act\" (H.R. 32) defines \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" as states or localities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, such as by restricting information sharing or refusing to honor DHS detainer requests. The bill makes these jurisdictions ineligible for federal funds intended to be used for benefits\u2014including food, shelter, healthcare, and legal services\u2014for undocumented immigrants. It provides an exception for jurisdictions protecting crime victims or witnesses. The Act also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit an annual report to Congress listing non-compliant jurisdictions.",
