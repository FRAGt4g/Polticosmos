    "summary": "This bill, the Border Security Investment Act, proposes funding border security by imposing a 37% fee on remittance transfers sent to the top five countries from which individuals unlawfully enter the U.S. The collected revenue would be deposited into two new trust funds. 50% would go to the `Border Security State Reimbursement Trust Fund` to reimburse border states for security expenses. The other 50% would go to the `Border Security Trust Fund` to pay for technology, physical barriers, and Border Patrol wages. If the funds exceed $50 billion, the excess is used for deficit reduction.",
