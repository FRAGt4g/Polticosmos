    "summary": "This bill, the \"Citizen Only Updated National Tally Act\" (COUNT Act), mandates the Department of Commerce and other federal agencies to collect and centralize data on the citizenship status of individuals residing in the United States. It requires agencies to provide access to administrative records, including those from Homeland Security, State Department, and Social Security Administration. The bill also directs the inclusion of a citizenship question in the 2030 census and other surveys, and prohibits the use of differential privacy processes by the Census Bureau. Its aim is to improve data accuracy on citizen numbers to inform immigration policy.",
