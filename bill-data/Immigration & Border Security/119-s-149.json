    "summary": "The 'Public Safety First Act' aims to mandate the Secretary of Homeland Security to detain aliens charged with theft in the U.S. It amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include those charged with burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, assault of a law enforcement officer, or crimes resulting in death or serious bodily injury. The bill defines relevant terms based on the jurisdiction where the acts occurred and requires the Secretary to issue a detainer and take custody of the alien if not already detained by other officials.",
