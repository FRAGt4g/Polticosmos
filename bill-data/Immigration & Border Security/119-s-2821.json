    "summary": "The 'American Tech Workforce Act of 2025' aims to reform the H-1B visa program. It seeks to curb the use of this visa for underpaid foreign labor and targets the Optional Practical Training Program. The bill mandates higher minimum wages for H-1B visa holders and prioritizes petitions with higher compensation. It also limits visa validity for work at third-party sites and restricts employment authorization for student visa holders after completing their studies. The goal is to protect American workers and incentivize hiring within the US labor market.",
