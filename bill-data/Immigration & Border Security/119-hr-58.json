    "summary": "The Voter Integrity Protection Act (H.R. 58) proposes amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to heighten penalties for unlawfully present aliens who vote in federal elections. The bill would classify this act as an 'aggravated felony,' a designation carrying severe immigration consequences, including bars to relief from removal. It also explicitly adds this offense to the list of deportable acts. The legislation, introduced by Representatives Biggs and Mace, aims to deter non-citizen voting by making the legal repercussions, specifically deportation and other immigration penalties, more severe and explicit.",
