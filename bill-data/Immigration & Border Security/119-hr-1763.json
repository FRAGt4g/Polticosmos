    "summary": "This bill is for the relief of Diego Montoya Bedoya. It grants him permanent resident status, allows adjustment of status if he enters the U.S. before a deadline, and waives certain grounds for removal or denial of admission. It also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to rescind any outstanding removal orders against him. The bill outlines application deadlines, reduces the number of immigrant visas available to his country of origin, and denies preferential immigration treatment to his relatives. Finally, it addresses the budgetary effects of the Act.",
