    "summary": "The 'Red Light Act' proposes to withhold 100% of certain federal highway funds from states that issue driver's licenses or identification cards to unlawfully present aliens. The bill stipulates that a state can have its funding restored if it repeals the offending law within the same fiscal year. If the state remains non-compliant, the withheld funds will be reapportioned among the compliant states. The legislation uses federal transportation funding as leverage to influence state-level policies on identification for undocumented immigrants.",
