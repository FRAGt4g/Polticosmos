    "summary": "The Protect Adoptees and American Families Act (PAAF Act) aims to automatically grant U.S. citizenship to certain internationally adopted individuals. It amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include adopted children of U.S. citizens. Specifically, it focuses on those adopted before age 18, with specific stipulations regarding physical presence in the U.S. and lawful admission. The bill also addresses cases where individuals may not have resided in the U.S. previously, outlining conditions for citizenship acquisition upon lawful admission and addressing inadmissibility grounds while mandating criminal background checks.",
