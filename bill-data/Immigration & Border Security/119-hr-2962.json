    "summary": "The Border Airport Fairness Act of 2025 mandates the President to designate certain airports near the U.S. borders as ports of entry. These airports must be primary airports within 30 miles of the northern or southern border, associated with a border crossing or seaport, and meet specific criteria outlined in Customs and Border Protection guidelines. Upon designation, the user fee requirement for these airports under the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 is terminated.",
