    "summary": "The bill, titled the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to limit immigration enforcement actions near sensitive locations such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship. It defines \"sensitive locations\" extensively and restricts enforcement actions (apprehensions, arrests, interviews, etc.). It mandates training for officers, reporting requirements to DHS Inspector General and Congress, and outlines exceptions for exigent circumstances and specific arrest operations. The bill also specifies penalties for violations and details definitions for key terms.",
