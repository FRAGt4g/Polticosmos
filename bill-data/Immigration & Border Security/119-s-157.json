    "summary": "The bill, known as the CONTAINER Act, authorizes certain border states to place temporary, movable structures on federal land along the northern and southern borders to secure those borders. The Secretary concerned (Interior or Agriculture) is not required to approve a special use authorization for said structures, provided the state provides 45 days notice. The structures can be in place for up to a year, with possible 90-day extensions if U.S. Customs and Border Protection determines operational control hasn't been achieved.",
