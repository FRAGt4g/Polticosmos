    "summary": "The 'State Accountability for Federal Deployment Costs Act of 2025' mandates that states reimburse the federal government for costs incurred when federal military forces are deployed to address civil disturbances or security threats resulting from a state's non-cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The bill outlines the reimbursement process, including covered costs like travel and lodging, and specifies that the Secretary of Homeland Security determines non-cooperation.  Non-payment allows the President to offset the debt by rescinding federal grants to the state.",
