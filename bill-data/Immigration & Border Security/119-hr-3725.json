    "summary": "This bill, the 'Preventing the Abuse of Immigration Parole Act,' aims to reform the process for granting immigration parole. It addresses concerns about the alleged abuse of parole under the Biden administration, proposes limiting the number of parole grants annually, and restricts parole for individuals from countries of concern without a waiver. The bill also grants states standing to sue the Department of Homeland Security if they believe parole is improperly granted and causes them harm.",
