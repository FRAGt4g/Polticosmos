    "summary": "The No Student Visas for Sanctuary Cities Act of 2025 aims to restrict the issuance of F-visas (for academic students) and M-visas (for vocational students) to institutions located in sanctuary jurisdictions. It defines \"sanctuary jurisdiction\" as any state or local government with policies that obstruct immigration enforcement, such as refusing to comply with ICE detainers or impeding communication with federal immigration officers. The bill allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to remove a jurisdiction from the list once it changes its policies.",
