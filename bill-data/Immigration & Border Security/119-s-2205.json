    "summary": "The Equal Representation Act mandates a citizenship question on the decennial census, requiring the Secretary of Commerce to report citizen and non-citizen population counts by state. It also modifies the apportionment of Representatives, basing it on the number of U.S. citizens rather than the total population, impacting electoral vote calculations. The bill includes a severability clause to protect the remaining provisions if any part is deemed unconstitutional.",
