    "summary": "The \"Protecting America From Spies Act\" amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to expand the reasons a foreign national can be deemed inadmissible to the U.S. It specifies that any individual a consular or immigration officer has \"reasonable ground to believe\" has engaged, or will engage, in espionage, sabotage, or illegal export of U.S. technology or sensitive information will be denied entry. The bill also makes individuals inadmissible if they seek to engage in any other unlawful activity or seek to overthrow the U.S. government. These new restrictions also apply to the spouses and children of such individuals.",
