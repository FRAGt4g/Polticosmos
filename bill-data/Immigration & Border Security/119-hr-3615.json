    "summary": "The Stop Aid for Foreign Expulsion Act (SAFE Act) prohibits the use of federal funds to pay foreign entities for the detention of individuals if a U.S. court has ruled that such detention violates U.S. laws. The bill defines a 'foreign entity' as one not organized under U.S. law. It aims to prevent the expenditure of U.S. funds on detentions deemed unlawful by the U.S. court system.",
