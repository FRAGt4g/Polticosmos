    "summary": "The PRINTS Act (Preventing the Recycling of Immigrants is Necessary for Trafficking Suspension Act) aims to combat child trafficking by requiring fingerprinting of noncitizen minors suspected of being trafficking victims upon entry to the U.S. It mandates the public disclosure of fingerprinting and apprehension data by CBP. The bill also criminalizes adults who exploit unrelated minors to enter the U.S. and calls for information sharing between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services. Finally, it outlines reporting requirements to Congress and online publication of data related to child trafficking.",
