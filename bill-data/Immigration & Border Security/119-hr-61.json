    "summary": "The \"Ensuring United Families at the Border Act\" amends the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 to alter family detention standards. It specifies that the detention of accompanied migrant children is governed by the Immigration and Nationality Act, removing any presumption against their detention. The bill mandates that the Department of Homeland Security detains parents charged with improper entry together with their children. It also seeks to supersede judicial interpretations of the Flores Settlement Agreement that limit family detention and preempts state licensing requirements for facilities housing migrant families.",
