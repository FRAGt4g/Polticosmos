    "summary": "The Advanced Border Coordination Act of 2025 directs the Department of Homeland Security to establish at least two Joint Operations Centers along the U.S. southern border within six months. These centers will serve as unified hubs for Federal, State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies to enhance coordination and information sharing. The focus is on combating criminal activities like human and drug trafficking, illegal crossings, and terrorism. The bill also mandates annual reporting to Congress on the centers' operations, resource use, and challenges to improve overall border security.",
