    "summary": "The 'Consequences for Social Security Fraud Act' (H.R. 174) amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make non-citizens inadmissible to and deportable from the United States. This applies to individuals who are convicted of, admit to committing, or admit to acts constituting fraud related to Social Security numbers/cards, identification documents, or specific COVID-19 relief funds (such as certain SBA loans and American Rescue Plan grants). The bill explicitly adds these offenses, including conspiracy to commit them, to the list of crimes that can prevent an individual from entering or remaining in the U.S.",
