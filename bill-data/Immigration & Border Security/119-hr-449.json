    "summary": "This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to streamline the naturalization process for United States nationals, such as those from American Samoa. For nationals who have lived in a U.S. state or outlying possession since birth, it waives requirements like the English and civics tests. The legislation also mandates that naturalization services be made available in outlying possessions, making citizenship more accessible without relocation. It recognizes the high rate of military service among U.S. nationals and aims to expedite their path to full citizenship, potentially with a reduced application fee.",
