    "summary": "The 'End FEMA Benefits for Illegal Immigrants Act' (S. 771) aims to terminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Shelter and Services Program, which provides support for sheltering and related activities for non-federal entities, specifically those assisting U.S. Customs and Border Protection with overcrowding in short-term holding facilities. The bill also rescinds unobligated funds previously allocated to FEMA for this purpose, including funds from the 2023 and 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Acts.",
