    "summary": "The 'End DED Act' aims to prohibit the use of federal funds for the Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) program and any successor programs. The bill highlights the program's origins in the executive branch, its lack of statutory basis in the Immigration and Nationality Act, and its perceived encroachment on Congress's immigration authority. The bill argues that Congress has plenary power over immigration and established Temporary Protected Status (TPS) as a mechanism to provide temporary relief to foreign nationals.",
