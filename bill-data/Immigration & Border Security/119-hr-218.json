    "summary": "H.R. 218, the 'State Immigration Enforcement Act,' grants states and their political subdivisions the authority to enact and enforce their own criminal and civil penalties for immigration violations. The bill stipulates that these state-level penalties must not exceed the corresponding federal penalties for the same conduct. It also amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to remove a provision that currently prevents states from imposing sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized immigrants, thereby empowering states to enforce immigration law locally, particularly in the context of employment.",
