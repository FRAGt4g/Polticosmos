    "summary": "The Border Lands Conservation Act focuses on managing federal land along the U.S. southern and northern borders. It mandates the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to inventory and install navigable roads, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, to deter illegal crossings and increase border patrol access. The bill includes provisions for search and rescue, fuel management initiatives to reduce fire risks, and reports to Congress on environmental degradation and impacts of illegal immigration. It also prohibits the use of federal funds for housing unauthorized immigrants on federal lands, with exceptions.",
