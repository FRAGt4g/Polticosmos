    "summary": "This bill, HR 5418, grants permanent resident status to Blanca Martinez. It allows her to apply for an immigrant visa or adjust her status to lawful permanent resident. It waives certain grounds for removal or denial of admission, and the Secretary of Homeland Security will rescind any outstanding removal orders against her. The application must be filed within two years of the bill's enactment. Upon approval, the Secretary of State will reduce the number of available immigrant visas for her country of origin. The bill also denies preferential immigration treatment for Martinez's parents, brothers, and sisters.",
