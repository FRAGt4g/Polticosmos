    "summary": "The \"Protecting our Communities from Sexual Predators Act\" amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to target non-citizens involved in sexual assault. The bill mandates the detention of certain aliens who are charged with, arrested for, or convicted of sexual assault. It also makes sexual assault a specific offense that renders a non-citizen inadmissible to the United States (barring entry) and deportable (subject to removal if already in the country). This applies to individuals who are convicted of, or who admit to committing, such an offense, aiming to enhance public safety by removing these individuals.",
