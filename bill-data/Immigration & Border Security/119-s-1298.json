    "summary": "The Religious Workforce Protection Act aims to assist religious workers experiencing delays in obtaining permanent residency. It allows eligible religious workers to extend their nonimmigrant status while their immigrant visa applications are processed, despite the usual 5-year limit. The bill also provides limited job flexibility and exempts certain religious workers from a one-year foreign residence requirement. This legislation is designed to alleviate the immigration challenges faced by religious workers navigating long processing backlogs. ",
