    "summary": "This bill, the Restoring Biological Truth in Government Act, aims to restrict how executive agencies collect information on sex and gender. It prohibits agencies from asking about gender identity on forms and surveys, mandates that only male and female options be offered for sex/gender questions, and will reject submissions that include other answers. It also defines key terms like \"male,\" \"female,\" \"gender,\" and \"gender identity\" with a focus on biological definitions.",
