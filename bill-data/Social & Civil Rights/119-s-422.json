    "summary": "The Right to Contraception Act (S. 422) seeks to codify the right to contraception, protecting an individual's ability to access contraceptives and engage in contraception, as well as a healthcare provider's ability to provide related services. The bill defines key terms, cites Supreme Court precedents, and outlines findings emphasizing contraception as a fundamental right and essential healthcare.  It establishes statutory rights, limits on restrictions, and enforcement mechanisms through legal action, aiming to preempt federal and state laws that impede access to contraception.  The act emphasizes the importance of contraception for all, especially marginalized groups.",
