It introduces exceptions to the act's application, specifically concerning laws that protect against discrimination, promote equal opportunity, ensure worker rights, and protect children. It also clarifies the applicability of the act regarding litigation. The bill prioritizes the balance between religious freedom and the protection of vulnerable groups, and seeks to resolve conflicts when federal laws are concerned. ",
