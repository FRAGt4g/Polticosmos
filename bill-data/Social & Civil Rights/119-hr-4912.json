    "summary": "The Help America Run Act aims to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to allow campaign funds to be used for child care, elder care, and health insurance premiums for candidates. The bill's intent is to remove financial barriers that prevent everyday Americans from running for office and to create a more representative Congress. It argues that current laws favor the independently wealthy and disadvantage those with caregiving responsibilities or who rely on their jobs for benefits. The Act seeks to broaden the pool of potential candidates, leading to better policy for all Americans.",
