Key provisions include establishing uniform federal standards for mail-in voting, such as deadlines, signature requirements, and limitations on ballot collection. It mandates a national system for automatic voter registration through government agencies, with an opt-out for citizens. The act requires uniform election administration procedures and equal funding for different voting methods within each state. It also establishes a national voter database managed by CISA to help states maintain accurate voter rolls by identifying duplicate registrations and deceased voters.",
