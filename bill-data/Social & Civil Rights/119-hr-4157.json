    "summary": "The Equal Dignity for Married Taxpayers Act aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure that all legally married same-sex couples are treated the same as other married couples under federal tax laws. The bill makes numerous changes, replacing gendered terms and phrases like \"husband and wife\" and \"his/her spouse\" with gender-neutral alternatives like \"married couple\" and \"the individual's spouse\" throughout the tax code. It covers a wide range of tax provisions, ensuring equal application regardless of sexual orientation.",
