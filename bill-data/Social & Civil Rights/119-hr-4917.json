    "summary": "The 'Expanding the Voluntary Opportunities for Translations in Elections Act' (Expanding the VOTE Act) amends the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to modify language minority notice requirements, particularly relating to American Indian and Alaska Native languages. It mandates the provision of voting materials in the language of applicable minority groups and English. The bill also provides grants to jurisdictions to incentivize the provision of voting materials in languages not currently covered under Section 203. Finally, it calls for a study on the impact of reducing language minority thresholds and expanding the definition of language minorities.",
