    "summary": "The 'Empower Parents to Protect their Kids Act of 2025' aims to restrict how schools address students' gender identity. It mandates parental consent for any accommodations related to gender transition, prohibits schools from withholding information from parents about a student's gender identity, and provides definitions for key terms like 'gender transition'. The bill threatens to withhold federal funds from schools that don't comply and allows for civil actions against schools that violate these provisions, potentially including financial compensation for harm. It defines sex and gender in biological terms.",
