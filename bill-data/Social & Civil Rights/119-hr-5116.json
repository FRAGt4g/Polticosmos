    "summary": "This bill, the \"Empower Parents to Protect their Kids Act,\" aims to require elementary and secondary schools receiving federal funds to obtain parental consent before facilitating a child's gender transition in any form. It prohibits schools from assisting in a student's social or physical transition without parental consent, withholding information from parents about a student's gender identity concerns, or pressuring parents or students regarding gender affirming care. The bill also defines key terms and allows for civil action for violations, including potential for injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and payment for treatments to repair harm from gender transition.",
