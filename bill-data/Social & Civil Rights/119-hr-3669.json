    "summary": "The REAL ID Gender Requirement Reform Act amends the REAL ID Act of 2005. The bill allows states to decide whether to include gender or sex designations on driver's licenses and ID cards. If a state chooses to include gender/sex, individuals can self-identify without additional documentation, and states must offer an unspecified or other gender option. The bill also makes a technical amendment to the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007.",
