    "summary": "The Housing not Handcuffs Act of 2025 aims to prevent the criminalization of homelessness on federal public lands. It prohibits federal agencies from penalizing homeless individuals for engaging in life-sustaining activities like resting, seeking donations, or using public accommodations, and it protects their right to store personal property. The bill allows exceptions if adequate indoor shelter is available. It grants individuals harmed by violations a right to sue, and it provides an affirmative defense for homeless individuals charged with violating laws criminalizing life-sustaining activities when adequate shelter is unavailable. The bill defines key terms, including 'homeless individual' and 'public land'.",
