    "summary": "The Social Security Overpayment Relief Act aims to amend the Social Security Act to limit the recovery of overpayments under titles II and XVI. It proposes that the government cannot recover overpayments from individuals if the overpayment occurred 10 or more years prior to the date the Commissioner identifies the overpayment. This would provide some financial relief to beneficiaries who may have been overpaid in the past.",
