    "summary": "The 'People Over Long Lines Act' (POLL Act) aims to reduce voter wait times in federal elections. It mandates that states create plans to ensure wait times are less than 30 minutes, with the Attorney General establishing standards. It also establishes remedial plans for states with excessive wait times, provides emergency paper ballots when equipment fails, and prohibits chief election officials from campaign activities. Additionally, the bill introduces minimum requirements for voting systems, poll workers, and election resources and provides payments to states for implementation. It also includes provision for private right of action for unreasonable voter waiting time. This bill amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) and related federal election laws.",
