    "summary": "The Equality Act amends existing federal civil rights laws to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. It extends these protections to various areas including employment, housing, public accommodations, federally funded programs, credit, and jury service. The bill codifies protections for LGBTQ+ individuals by clarifying that discrimination 'on the basis of sex' includes sexual orientation and gender identity, thereby expanding on the Supreme Court's Bostock v. Clayton County ruling. It also specifies that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act cannot be used as a defense against claims of discrimination brought under these provisions.",
