    "summary": "The 'Recouping Educational Contributions Linked to Antisemitic Institutional Misconduct Act' (RECLAIM Act) amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It broadens the scope of non-compliance findings in programs receiving federal financial assistance, allowing for recoupment of funds if a recipient is found non-compliant. The bill also restricts future federal financial assistance to recipients in violation of title, pending court certification of compliance or a one-year period, requiring inter-agency notification of injunctions.",
