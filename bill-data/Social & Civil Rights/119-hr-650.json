    "summary": "The Families' Rights and Responsibilities Act aims to protect the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and healthcare of their children. The bill establishes that government cannot infringe on this right without a compelling interest and uses strict scrutiny as the standard of review. It defines key terms like \"government,\" \"parent,\" \"child,\" and \"substantial burden,\" and outlines the rights protected, including educational choices, religious upbringing, and access to medical records. It also provides a judicial remedy for violations and addresses attorneys' fees.",
