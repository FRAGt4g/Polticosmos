    "summary": "The Pink Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 3374) prohibits the pricing of substantially similar consumer products and services differently based on the gender of the intended user. It defines 'substantially similar' for products and services and grants enforcement powers to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). State attorneys general can bring civil actions for violations, and the bill outlines rules for notice and intervention by the FTC, as well as actions permitted by other state officials. It also includes definitions for key terms like 'Commission' and 'consumer product'.",
