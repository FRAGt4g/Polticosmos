    "summary": "The 'Define to Defeat Act of 2025' aims to combat antisemitism by codifying the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition into federal law. It mandates the inclusion of this definition in anti-discrimination training for federal agencies and instructs juries to consider it in antisemitism-related cases. The bill specifies that it doesn't expand existing federal agency authority, alter standards for violations, or infringe on existing rights, and will not affect First Amendment rights. It defines \"antisemitism\" based on the IHRA definition and lists 'covered civil rights laws'.",
