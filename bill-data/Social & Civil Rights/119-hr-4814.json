    "summary": "The Supplemental Security Income Equality Act (H.R. 4814) aims to extend the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program to residents of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the United States Virgin Islands. The bill amends existing social security laws to include these territories, removing limitations on payments and ensuring that United States nationals are treated the same as citizens in terms of eligibility. It also grants the Commissioner of Social Security the authority to adjust program requirements for these territories as needed. The effective date is the first day of the fiscal year beginning one year or more after enactment.",
