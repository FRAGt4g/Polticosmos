    "summary": "This bill, the \"Eliminating the Marriage Penalty in SSI Act\" (EMPSA), amends Title XVI of the Social Security Act to prevent the reduction of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities due to marriage. It ensures that married individuals meeting specific criteria related to age, disability diagnosis, income, and resources receive benefits at the same rate as unmarried individuals, disregarding the income and resources of their spouse when determining eligibility and benefit amounts. The changes take effect 180 days after the bill's enactment.",
