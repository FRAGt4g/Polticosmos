    "summary": "The Women's Health Protection Act of 2025 aims to protect a person's ability to seek and obtain abortion services and a health care provider's ability to provide them, free from unwarranted restrictions. The bill defines key terms, outlines protected activities and services (both pre- and post-viability), and protects the right to travel for reproductive health services. It supersedes conflicting federal or state laws, provides for enforcement through civil actions, and clarifies rules of construction. The bill also addresses factors considered in determining restrictions and allows for pre-enforcement challenges.",
