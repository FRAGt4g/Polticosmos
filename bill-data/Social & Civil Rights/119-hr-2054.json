    "summary": "The 'Voting Only Through English Act' (H.R. 2054) aims to restrict federal funding to states that provide ballots for federal elections in languages other than English. The bill amends the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by eliminating sections related to language assistance in voting and reinforces the idea that federal funds should only go to states that conduct voting in English.",
