    "summary": "This bill, introduced in the Senate, mandates that the Social Security Administration (SSA) provide Social Security beneficiaries with regular statements. It requires the SSA to mail paper statements to individuals with social security account numbers upon entering the workforce or starting a new job, and then periodically based on age (every 5 years starting at age 25, every 2 years starting at 55, and annually from 60). Individuals are given the option to opt out of receiving paper statements. The bill also authorizes appropriations for administrative expenses related to its implementation, starting in fiscal year 2026.",
