    "summary": "The Menstrual Equity For All Act of 2025 aims to increase access to menstrual products for individuals with limited access. It mandates free product provision in schools, institutions of higher education, correctional facilities, and federal buildings. It also provides funding through Medicaid, social services block grants, and TANF programs. Additionally, the bill prohibits state and local governments from taxing menstrual products and requires employers with over 100 employees to provide them free of charge.",
