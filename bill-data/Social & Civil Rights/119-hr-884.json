    "summary": "This bill, HR 884, aims to prohibit non-citizens from voting in elections within the District of Columbia. It also seeks to repeal the Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022, effectively restoring the previous legal framework regarding voter eligibility. The bill's proponents believe that only US citizens should participate in elections within the DC, a direct challenge to the precedent that allows for some non-citizen voting in DC. The bill was introduced to the House of Representatives on January 31, 2025.",
