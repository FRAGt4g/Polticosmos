    "summary": "This bill, the Promoting Respect for Individuals\u2019 Dignity and Equality Act of 2025 (PRIDE Act of 2025), primarily addresses tax code revisions to ensure equal treatment for legally married same-sex couples. It extends the statute of limitations for amending tax returns, clarifies that all provisions apply equally to same-sex couples, and amends numerous sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to replace gendered terms (e.g., \"husband and wife\") with gender-neutral alternatives (e.g., \"married couple\"). The bill also makes conforming amendments throughout the tax code.",
