    "summary": "The 'Consent is Key Act' aims to encourage states to pass laws allowing civil damages for nonconsensual sexual protection barrier removal. It directs the Attorney General to increase funding for states with such laws, specifically via the Sexual Assault Services Program. Funding increases are capped at 20% of past grant amounts for a four-year period, with a limit of four increases. The bill defines key terms like \"nonconsensual sexual protection barrier removal\" and \"sexual protection barrier\" and authorizes $5 million annually from 2026-2030 to carry out the act.",
