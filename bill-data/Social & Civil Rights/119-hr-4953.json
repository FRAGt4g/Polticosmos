    "summary": "The Gender-Affirming Child Abuse Prevention Act authorizes civil actions for individuals who underwent gender-related medical treatment while minors. It defines gender-related medical treatments, specifying surgical procedures, hormone treatments, and puberty blockers. These treatments, performed on minors, would allow the individual to sue the medical provider. The bill defines key terms like 'gender,' 'sex,' 'male,' 'female,' and 'minor,' and specifies circumstances under which the civil action can be brought. The bill also specifies what treatments would be exempt from the definition such as the treatment for disorders of sex development. The act provides for potential financial compensation including actual and liquidated damages, along with costs and attorney's fees.",
