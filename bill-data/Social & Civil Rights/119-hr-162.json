    "summary": "The \"First Amendment Accountability Act\" (H.R. 162) creates a new legal right for individuals to sue federal employees in their personal capacity for violating their First Amendment rights. This right of action applies when an executive branch employee, acting under the authority of their position, deprives a person of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the First Amendment. The bill allows the winning party in a lawsuit to recover attorney's fees. It explicitly excludes the President and Vice President and prevents federal employees from using this act to sue the government over employment matters.",
