    "summary": "The Restoring Equal Opportunity Act aims to amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act to prohibit disparate-impact claims. The bill seeks to eliminate the use of disparate-impact liability in employment and housing practices. It defines disparate impact and nullifies specific regulations related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The bill explicitly prevents legal action based on practices that, while neutral on their face, may have a disproportionate effect on protected groups.",
