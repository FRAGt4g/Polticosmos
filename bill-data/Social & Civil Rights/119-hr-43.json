    "summary": "This bill, the \"Alaska Native Village Municipal Lands Restoration Act of 2025,\" amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. It allows Alaska Native Village Corporations to reclaim land they previously placed in trust with the State of Alaska for the future creation of a Municipal Corporation, provided that municipality has not yet been formed. The bill also eliminates the requirement for Village Corporations to convey any more land for this purpose. Upon reversion, the land title returns to the Village Corporation, which must honor any existing rights, easements, and lease agreements established under the trust.",
