It defines terms like 'male,' 'female,' 'boy,' 'girl,' and 'sex' based on biological characteristics at conception, specifically pertaining to reproductive systems. The bill also clarifies that gender identity, as a subjective sense of self, will not be recognized by the federal government as a substitute for biological sex.",
