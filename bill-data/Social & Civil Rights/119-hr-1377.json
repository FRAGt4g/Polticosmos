    "summary": "This bill, the Sarah Keys Evans Congressional Gold Medal Act, aims to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Sarah Keys Evans in recognition of her contributions to civil rights. The bill highlights Evans's courageous act of refusing to give up her seat on an interstate bus, which led to a landmark court case that outlawed segregation on interstate buses. It authorizes the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate to arrange the medal's presentation and instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to strike the medal and duplicate bronze medals for sale.",
