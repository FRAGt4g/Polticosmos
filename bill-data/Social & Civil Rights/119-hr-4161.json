    "summary": "The Fair Calculations in Civil Damages Act of 2025 prohibits federal courts from considering race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation when calculating a plaintiff's future earning potential in civil actions. The bill defines key terms, directs the Secretary of Labor to develop guidance for inclusive future earnings tables, mandates studies on damages awarded and on age/disability considerations, and requires the Federal Judicial Center to train judges on implementation. The goal is to ensure fairness and prevent bias in damage calculations.",
