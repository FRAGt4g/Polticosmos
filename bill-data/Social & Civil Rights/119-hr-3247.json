    "summary": "The 'Sensible Adoption For Every Home Act' (SAFE Home Act) prohibits entities receiving federal assistance for adoption or foster care from delaying or denying placements or discriminating against prospective parents based on their views on a child's gender identity. It defines 'sex' as biological sex (male or female) and outlines specific conditions related to parental decisions on medical treatments, documentation, and care. The bill amends the Social Security Act and includes provisions for the effective date and potential delays for states requiring legislative changes.",
