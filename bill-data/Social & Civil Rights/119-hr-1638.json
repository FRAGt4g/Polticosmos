The bill explicitly protects hairstyles commonly associated with a particular race or national origin, such as locs, cornrows, and Afros. It amends existing civil rights laws to include hair texture and hairstyle as protected characteristics, ensuring equal opportunities for individuals regardless of their hair.",
