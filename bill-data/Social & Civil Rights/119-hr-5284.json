    "summary": "The Claiming Age Clarity Act (H.R. 5284) mandates the Social Security Administration to revise terminology used in its materials. It replaces terms like \"early eligibility age,\" \"full retirement age,\" and \"delayed retirement credit\" with new language such as \"minimum monthly benefit age,\" \"standard monthly benefit age,\" and \"maximum monthly benefit age.\" This change aims to improve clarity in Social Security materials by January 1, 2027.",
