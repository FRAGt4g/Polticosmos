    "summary": "The \"Lumbee Fairness Act\" proposes to amend the Lumbee Act of 1956 to grant full federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. This action would make the tribe and its members eligible for all federal services and benefits provided to recognized Indian tribes, designating Robeson, Cumberland, Hoke, and Scotland counties as their service area. The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for the tribe and establishes a process for verifying the tribal roll. It also specifies that North Carolina will retain civil and criminal jurisdiction over tribal lands.",
