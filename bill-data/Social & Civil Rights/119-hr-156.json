    "summary": "The \"Securing our Elections Act of 2025\" proposes a national standard for photo identification to vote in federal elections, amending the Help America Vote Act of 2002. It requires in-person voters to present a valid photo ID. Individuals without an ID may cast a provisional ballot but must present the ID or a religious objection affidavit within three days. For mail-in voting, a copy of a photo ID or the last four digits of a Social Security number with an affidavit is required. The bill also mandates that states provide free photo IDs for those who cannot afford them.",
