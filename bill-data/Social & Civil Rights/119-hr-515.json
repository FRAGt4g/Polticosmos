    "summary": "The \"Ensuring Military Readiness Not Discrimination Act\" (H.R. 515) amends Title 10 of the U.S. Code to prohibit discrimination within the Armed Forces. The bill mandates that eligibility for military service and personnel policies must be based on an individual's ability to meet occupational standards, not on their race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. The definition of sex is explicitly inclusive of gender identity, sexual orientation, and sex characteristics (like intersex traits). This legislation seeks to ensure equality of treatment and opportunity for all service members, codifying nondiscrimination as a core principle.",
