    "summary": "The Equality Act (S. 1503) aims to prohibit discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. It amends existing civil rights laws, including those concerning public accommodations, federal funding, employment, housing, credit, and jury service, to explicitly include these protections. The bill defines key terms like \"gender identity\" and \"sexual orientation\" and provides rules of construction to guide interpretation. It seeks to ensure equal treatment and remedies for LGBTQ+ individuals and women across various sectors.",
