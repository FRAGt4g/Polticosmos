    "summary": "This bill, HR 1499, amends the Grand Ronde Reservation Act to address the hunting, fishing, trapping, and animal gathering rights of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community. It clarifies the existing hunting and fishing agreement, outlines conditions for future agreements between the tribe and the State of Oregon, and addresses judicial review related to the Consent Decree. The bill emphasizes that any new agreements derive authority solely from the State of Oregon and shouldn't affect the rights of other tribes.",
