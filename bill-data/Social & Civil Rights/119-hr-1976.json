    "summary": "The 'Woman on the Twenty Act of 2025' mandates that the $20 bill feature a portrait of Harriet Tubman. The bill amends U.S. Code Title 31, specifying that no $20 note printed after December 31, 2028, can be without Tubman's portrait. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to release the preliminary design by December 31, 2026. The bill highlights the historical context of U.S. currency and the absence of women on paper money until the planned change announced in 2016.",
