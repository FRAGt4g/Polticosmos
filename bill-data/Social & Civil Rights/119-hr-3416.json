    "summary": "The Accessibility Constituent Communication Act of 2025 mandates that all federal agencies provide communications to blind or visually impaired individuals in accessible formats. This includes Braille, large print, audio, and digital formats like accessible PDFs. Agencies must distribute accessible communications via mail or secure electronic systems, coordinating with standard formats. The bill defines \"agency\" and \"communication,\" and specifies that agencies in compliance are shielded from liability under the Americans with Disabilities Act regarding distribution of accessible information.",
