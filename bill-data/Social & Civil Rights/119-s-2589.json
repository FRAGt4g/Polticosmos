    "summary": "This bill, the Expanding the Voluntary Opportunities for Translations in Elections Act (Expanding the VOTE Act), aims to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to expand and clarify language minority notice requirements. It modifies the definition of \"voting materials\" to include digital materials, outlines state and political subdivision responsibilities for providing voting materials in multiple languages, and provides exceptions for unwritten languages, especially for Native American and Alaskan Native languages. The bill also authorizes grants to jurisdictions that provide voting materials in languages not currently covered under Section 203. Finally, it mandates a study by the Comptroller General on reducing threshold requirements and expanding the definition of language minorities.",
