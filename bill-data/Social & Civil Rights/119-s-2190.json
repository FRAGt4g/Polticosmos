    "summary": "The Fair Calculations in Civil Damages Act of 2025 prohibits federal courts from awarding damages based on a plaintiff's race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation when determining projected future earnings. It mandates that the Secretary of Labor develop guidance for creating unbiased future earnings tables and for states on calculating future earnings in tort proceedings. The bill also requires studies by the Judicial Conference of the United States and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and instructs the Federal Judicial Center to train federal judges on how to implement the act.",
