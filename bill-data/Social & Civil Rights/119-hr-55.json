    "summary": "Introduced by Representative Biggs of Arizona, H.R. 55 proposes the complete repeal of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. This law, also known as the \"Motor Voter Act,\" simplifies the registration process by allowing citizens to register to vote when applying for a driver's license, at public assistance agencies, and through mail-in forms. The bill's single provision would eliminate these federally mandated avenues for voter registration. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on House Administration for consideration.",
