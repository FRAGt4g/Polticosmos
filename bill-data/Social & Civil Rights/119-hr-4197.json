    "summary": "This bill, the LGBTQ+ Panic Defense Prohibition Act of 2025, aims to prohibit the use of the \"panic defense\" in federal criminal cases, which attempts to excuse or mitigate crimes based on the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity/expression. The bill finds that these defenses are outdated and discriminatory. It amends Title 18 of the United States Code to forbid them, while still allowing evidence of past trauma. The Attorney General is required to submit an annual report detailing relevant prosecutions.",
