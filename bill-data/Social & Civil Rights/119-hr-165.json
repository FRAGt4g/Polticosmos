    "summary": "This bill, titled the \"Wounded Knee Massacre Memorial and Sacred Site Act,\" directs the Secretary of the Interior to place approximately 40 acres of land at the Wounded Knee Massacre site into \"restricted fee status\" for the Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes. This status confirms tribal ownership, makes the land part of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, protects it from sale without congressional consent, and exempts it from state and local taxes. The land is to be used as a memorial and sacred site, and the bill explicitly prohibits any gaming activities on the property.",
