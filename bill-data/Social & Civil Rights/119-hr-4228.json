    "summary": "This bill, the \"Original Justice for living survivors of the 1921 Tulsa/Greenwood Race Massacre Act,\" proposes providing compensatory and punitive damages to the surviving victims of the massacre. It cites the historical injustice and the failure of local, state, and federal governments to provide redress. The bill mandates payments from the Treasury, certified by the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights upon proof of identity. These payments would satisfy all claims against the US for the described harm.",
