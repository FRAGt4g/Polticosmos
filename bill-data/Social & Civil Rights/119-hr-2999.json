    "summary": "This bill, HR 2999, amends Title II of the Social Security Act to limit the withholding of monthly benefits to recover overpayments. Specifically, it stipulates that not more than 10 percent of a monthly benefit can be withheld due to overpayments, unless the individual requests a higher recovery rate. This provision applies to overpayments where there is no evidence of fraud by the individual. The amendments take effect upon the bill's enactment and apply to outstanding overpayments.",
