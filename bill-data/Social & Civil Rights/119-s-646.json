    "summary": "The Born in the USA Act aims to prevent the use of federal funds to enforce Executive Order 14160, issued by President Trump, which sought to restrict birthright citizenship. The bill asserts that the Executive Order contradicts the 14th Amendment of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent (United States v. Wong Kim Ark) regarding birthright citizenship. It argues that birthright citizenship is constitutionally protected and cannot be revoked by executive order or congressional action.",
