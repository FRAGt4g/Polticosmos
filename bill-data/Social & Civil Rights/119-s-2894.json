    "summary": "This bill, the Reconciliation in Place Names Act, aims to establish a process for reviewing and revising offensive place names. It mandates the Secretary of the Interior to create an advisory committee to recommend and solicit proposals for renaming geographic features and Federal land units with offensive names. The Board on Geographic Names will then review these proposals, and if approved, rename the features. The bill seeks to address place names that perpetuate prejudice, disparage minorities, or honor those who committed injustices.",
