    "summary": "The Youth Homelessness Guaranteed Income Pilot Program Act of 2025 aims to address youth homelessness by establishing a pilot program to provide financial assistance (cash payments) and non-financial support services (housing navigation, financial coaching, workforce development, etc.) to eligible individuals aged 18-29. The bill mandates the creation of a database of homeless individuals, sets criteria for participant selection, and outlines privacy protections. It also establishes the National Youth Economic Advisory Council to advise on program implementation and evaluation. A study will assess the program's effects, and reports will be submitted to Congress.",
