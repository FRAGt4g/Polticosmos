    "summary": "The 'No Shari'a Act' aims to prevent the application of Shari'a (Islamic law) or any foreign law in U.S. courts if it violates constitutional rights. The bill asserts that the U.S. Constitution is supreme and seeks to protect constitutional rights, particularly concerning women, children, and vulnerable populations. It prohibits the enforcement of judgments, decrees, or arbitration decisions that rely on such laws and mandates the exclusive use of Federal and State law. The Attorney General is tasked with issuing regulations for uniform application.",
