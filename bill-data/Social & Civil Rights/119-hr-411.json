    "summary": "This bill, the \"Keweenaw Bay Indian Community Land Claim Settlement Act of 2025,\" authorizes a $33.9 million payment to the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community. The payment serves as compensation for the improper and uncompensated taking of reservation lands by the U.S. government, which were transferred to the State of Michigan. In exchange for the funds, the Community agrees to extinguish all historical claims to these lands, thereby providing clear title to current landowners. The settlement aims to provide justice for the Community while avoiding costly litigation and securing property rights for current owners.",
