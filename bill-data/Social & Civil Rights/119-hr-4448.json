    "summary": "The 'Restoring Equal Opportunity Act' aims to eliminate 'disparate-impact' claims in both employment and housing contexts.  It amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act, prohibiting legal actions based on employment or housing practices that, while neutral on their face, have a disproportionate effect on protected groups. The bill also nullifies specific regulations related to these laws.",
