    "summary": "The 'Original Securities and Exchange Atonement Act of 2025' amends the Securities Act of 1933 to mandate that covered issuers conduct racial equity audits every two years. These audits assess policies, practices, and historical ties to slavery. Issuers must disclose findings and steps to reconcile any identified ties. Non-compliance results in fines for issuers and employees, with funds allocated to initiatives for minority low-to-moderate-income communities and housing assistance. The bill also establishes an Office of Minority Low to Moderate Income Programs within the Treasury Department, providing grants for programs supporting atonement for descendants of enslaved persons.",
