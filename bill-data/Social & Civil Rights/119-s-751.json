    "summary": "The Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act of 2025 (CROWN Act of 2025) aims to prohibit discrimination based on hair texture and hairstyle in various settings. The bill amends existing civil rights laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, and Section 1977 of the Revised Statutes, to explicitly include hair texture and hairstyles commonly associated with race or national origin (e.g., locs, braids). The objective is to prevent discrimination in education, employment, housing, and public accommodations.",
