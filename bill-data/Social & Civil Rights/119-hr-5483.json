    "summary": "The Chloe Cole Act aims to prohibit healthcare professionals, hospitals, and clinics from performing chemical or surgical mutilation on children, defining such procedures as those intended to alter a child's body to no longer correspond to their sex. The bill provides a private right of action for affected individuals and their parents, allowing them to sue for damages. It outlines exceptions for certain medically necessary procedures and sets a statute of limitations for filing claims. It also clarifies the definition of 'sex' and the scope of prohibited activities.",
