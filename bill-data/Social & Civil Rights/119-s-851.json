    "summary": "The 'Guaranteeing Unalienable and Anatomical Rights for Dependents Act' (GUARD Act) aims to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. It would prevent states from receiving federal funding if they take adverse action against parents or guardians who oppose gender-affirming medical or social interventions for minors whose gender identity claims are inconsistent with their biological sex. The bill allows parents/guardians to sue the Department of Health and Human Services if this occurs.",
