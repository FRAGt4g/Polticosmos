    "summary": "The Truth in Gender Act of 2025 aims to define and codify sex based on biological characteristics (male and female) rather than gender identity. The bill mandates the use of these definitions across federal agencies, including in documents, policies, and government-issued IDs. It also addresses issues like prison detention, medical care, and access to single-sex spaces, while prohibiting the use of federal funds to promote 'gender ideology.' The act further directs the DOJ to issue guidance to correct prior legal interpretations of sex-based distinctions and requires federal agencies to report on the implementation of the act.",
