It mandates the creation of an advisory committee to solicit proposals, gather public input, and recommend name changes for geographic features and Federal land units containing offensive names. The bill defines \"offensive place name\" and outlines the committee's composition, duties, and operational guidelines, with the goal of promoting reconciliation and addressing historical injustices related to place names.",
