    "summary": "The Wounded Knee Massacre Memorial and Sacred Site Act directs the Secretary of the Interior to finalize the transfer of approximately 40 acres of land on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, to be held in restricted fee status. This status ensures the land remains under tribal ownership and jurisdiction, is protected from state and local taxation, and requires Congressional consent for transfer. The bill outlines permitted land usage based on a prior covenant, explicitly prohibiting gaming activities, and specifies that federal laws relating to Indian country apply.",
