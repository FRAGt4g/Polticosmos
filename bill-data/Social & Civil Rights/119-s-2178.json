    "summary": "The Equal Dignity for Married Taxpayers Act of 2025 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure that all legally married same-sex couples are treated the same as other married couples regarding federal tax provisions. The bill makes numerous technical changes throughout the code, replacing gendered terms and phrases like \"husband and wife\" and \"his spouse\" with gender-neutral alternatives like \"married couple\" and \"the individual's spouse,\" to remove any discriminatory language.",
