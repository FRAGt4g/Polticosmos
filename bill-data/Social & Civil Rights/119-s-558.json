    "summary": "This bill, the Antisemitism Awareness Act of 2025, aims to combat antisemitism in education by requiring the Department of Education to consider the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of antisemitism when investigating violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It asserts that discrimination against Jews can be a violation of Title VI when based on race, color, or national origin and encourages the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws related to antisemitism. The bill also cites the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.",
