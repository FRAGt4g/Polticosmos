    "summary": "The Unhoused VOTE Act aims to remove barriers to voting for unhoused individuals in federal elections. It mandates that states allow nontraditional abodes as valid addresses, accept alternative forms of identification, and provide information on voter registration and voting. The bill also establishes a grant program to support state and local efforts to improve access to voting for the unhoused, and promotes best practices. Finally, it modifies existing acts to include homeless shelters as voter registration agencies and allow for specific address location on voter registration forms.",
