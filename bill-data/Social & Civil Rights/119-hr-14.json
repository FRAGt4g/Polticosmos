    "summary": "The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2025 aims to restore and strengthen the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It establishes a new formula to determine which states and localities with a recent history of voting rights violations must preclear election changes with the federal government. It also requires nationwide, practice-based preclearance for specific policy changes like stricter voter ID laws or reducing polling places in diverse communities. The bill strengthens protections against vote dilution and denial, enhances transparency for election changes, and expands the ability of the Attorney General and citizens to sue to protect voting rights.",
