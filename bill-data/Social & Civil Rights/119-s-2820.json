    "summary": "The Same Day Registration Act mandates that states allow eligible individuals to register to vote on the day of a federal election, including early voting. It amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to include this requirement. States must comply by November 2026, with provisions for partial compliance initially. The bill also includes provisions for ensuring the availability of registration forms and details on enforcement. It aims to increase voter access by allowing eligible voters to register and vote on the same day.",
