    "summary": "The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to require individuals to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. The bill defines acceptable forms of proof, such as a REAL ID-compliant license, U.S. passport, or birth certificate. It mandates that states establish programs to verify citizenship and purge non-citizens from voter rolls, utilizing federal databases like the SAVE system. It also creates a private right of action and criminal penalties for election officials who register applicants without the required citizenship documentation.",
