    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 412, authorizes the Bay Mills Indian Community of Michigan to sell, lease, or otherwise convey any of its land or real property interests that are not held in trust by the United States. This allows the Tribe to manage these specific assets without further federal law or approval. The bill explicitly states this authority does not extend to lands held in trust by the U.S. for the Tribe's benefit. It also shields the U.S. government from liability for any losses resulting from these transactions, unless the U.S. is a direct party.",
