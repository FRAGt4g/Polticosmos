    "summary": "The Prison Rape Prevention Act of 2025 amends title 18 of the United States Code to mandate that the Bureau of Prisons house and transport prisoners based on their biological sex, not gender identity. It defines biological sex and elaborates on what constitutes 'gender-related medical treatment,' which the Bureau of Prisons would be prohibited from providing or funding. This includes a detailed list of surgical procedures, hormone treatments, and puberty blockers considered gender-affirming care, differentiated for male and female individuals. It excludes medical treatments for disorders of sex development or ambiguous biological sex characteristics.",
