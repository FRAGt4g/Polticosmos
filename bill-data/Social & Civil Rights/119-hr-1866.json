    "summary": "The 'Guaranteeing Unalienable and Anatomical Rights for Dependents Act' (GUARD Act) aims to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. It would disqualify states from receiving federal funding if they discriminate against parents or guardians who oppose medical, surgical, or social changes related to a minor's gender identity if that identity is considered inconsistent with their biological sex. The bill allows parents to sue the Department of Health and Human Services to stop funding to states that violate this provision.",
