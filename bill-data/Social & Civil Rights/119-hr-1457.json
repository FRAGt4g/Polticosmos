    "summary": "The 'IDs for an Inclusive Democracy Act' mandates the Social Security Administration to provide free federal identification cards to eligible US citizens. The bill outlines the card's content, security features, validity, and renewal process, and tasks the U.S. Postal Service with creating an application process. A Task Force on Federal Identification Cards will be established to determine production requirements and develop best practices for assisting vulnerable populations. The bill aims to facilitate identification requirements, potentially increasing voter access and access to essential services.",
