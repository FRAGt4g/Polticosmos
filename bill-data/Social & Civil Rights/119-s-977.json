    "summary": "This bill, the End Taxpayer Funding of Gender Experimentation Act of 2025, aims to prohibit the use of federal funds for gender transition procedures. It defines gender transition procedures, providing a lengthy list of prohibited interventions, and clarifies that this prohibition extends to health benefits plans, federal facilities, and employees. The bill includes exceptions for medically necessary procedures for intersex individuals and treatments for complications arising from gender transition procedures. It also amends the Affordable Care Act to disallow subsidies for plans covering these procedures, allowing separate coverage to be purchased with non-federal funds.",
