    "summary": "The Katrina and Leslie Schaller Act extends the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program to Guam. This includes amending existing legislation to include Guam in the definition of a 'State' for certain programs, eliminating limits on payments to Guam, and clarifying Guam's inclusion in the geographic meaning of the United States for SSI purposes. The bill grants the Commissioner of Social Security waiver authority to adapt the program to Guam's specific needs, with an effective date set for the first fiscal year beginning at least one year after enactment.",
