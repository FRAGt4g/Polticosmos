    "summary": "The 'Life at Conception Act' aims to grant equal protection under the 14th Amendment for the right to life of all human beings, born and preborn, from the moment of fertilization. It explicitly states it does not authorize the prosecution of women for the death of their unborn child. The bill defines \"human person\" to include all members of the homo sapiens species at all stages of life, from fertilization onward. The bill also clarifies that the term 'State' includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories.",
