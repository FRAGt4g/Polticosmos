It prevents states from restricting healthcare providers' ability to provide abortions to out-of-state patients, people's ability to travel for abortions, or assistance with such travel. It provides for enforcement by the Attorney General and a private right of action for those harmed by violations. The definition of 'abortion service' is expanded, and definitions of other terms are provided. A severability clause and rule of construction regarding travel are included.",
