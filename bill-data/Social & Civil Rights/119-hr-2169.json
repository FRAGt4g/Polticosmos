    "summary": "This bill, the Proper Celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and Inauguration Day Act, aims to ensure separate observances for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and Inauguration Day. It proposes amending U.S. Code to prevent Inauguration Day from overlapping with the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day holiday. If the two holidays coincide, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day would be observed on the Tuesday following the third Monday in January.",
