The bill also establishes civil actions for violations, including medical malpractice, and protects healthcare providers' rights of conscience. It defines sex-trait altering treatments and related terms, and prohibits schools from providing such treatments without parental consent. The bill amends existing law regarding female genital mutilation to include sex-trait altering treatments.",
