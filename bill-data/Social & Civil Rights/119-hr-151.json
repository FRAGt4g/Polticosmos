    "summary": "The \"Equal Representation Act\" mandates a citizenship question on the decennial census, starting in 2030, and requires public reporting of the results by state. The bill\u2019s central provision is to change the basis for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives. Instead of using the total population of all persons in a state, apportionment would be calculated using only the number of U.S. citizens. This change would also directly impact the allocation of Electoral College votes, shifting congressional representation to be based on the citizen population rather than the total resident population.",
