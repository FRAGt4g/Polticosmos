    "summary": "The Safeguarding Honest Speech Act (S. 839) aims to prohibit the use of federal funds to compel federal employees and contractors to use preferred pronouns or names that differ from an individual's legal name. It allows aggrieved parties to file civil actions against federal agencies for violations, with potential remedies including injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees. The bill defines \"sex\" based on reproductive biology and genetics at birth.",
