    "summary": "The 'Paws Off Act of 2025' (H.R. 237) proposes to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to protect dogs from accidental xylitol poisoning. It would mandate that any food product containing the sweetener xylitol must include a label warning that it is toxic to dogs if ingested. The bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish and finalize rules for this new labeling requirement within one year of the act's passage, classifying products without this warning as 'misbranded'. This ensures pet owners are aware of the potential danger.",
