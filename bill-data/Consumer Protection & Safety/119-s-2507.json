    "summary": "This bill, known as the DAIRY PRIDE Act, aims to regulate the labeling of food products that mimic dairy products. It mandates that products using dairy terms must adhere to the FDA's existing standards of identity for dairy. The bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to define what constitutes a dairy product and specifies enforcement against misbranded alternatives. It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue guidance on enforcement and report to Congress on actions taken.",
