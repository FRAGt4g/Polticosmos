    "summary": "The Honey Integrity Act aims to protect the integrity of honey marketed in the U.S. by establishing a standard of identity. It mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a program to detect adulteration, requiring honey packers to conduct testing, report findings, and refuse adulterated honey. The Secretary is required to investigate, test, and destroy adulterated honey, and share data with enforcement agencies and stakeholders. The bill also outlines fees, definitions, and interagency cooperation, specifically involving Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Agriculture, and the use of cutting-edge testing methods.",
