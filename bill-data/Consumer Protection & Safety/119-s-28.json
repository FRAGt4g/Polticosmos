    "summary": "This bill, the Informing Consumers about Smart Devices Act, mandates that manufacturers of internet-connected devices disclose whether their products contain a camera or microphone before purchase. It tasks the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with enforcing the Act, treating violations as unfair or deceptive practices. The FTC is also required to issue guidance to manufacturers on compliance. The Act defines 'covered devices' and excludes certain devices like phones and devices specifically marketed as cameras, along with devices related to telecommunications.",
