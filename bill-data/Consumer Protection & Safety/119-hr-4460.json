    "summary": "The Stop Agency Fiat Enforcement of Guidance Act (SAFE Guidance Act) requires financial agencies to include a \"guidance clarity statement\" on all new guidance documents. This statement clarifies that the guidance is not legally binding and does not create rights or obligations. This aims to limit the enforcement power of agency guidance. The bill defines \"financial agency\" and \"guidance\" and lists exemptions, such as rules issued through formal rulemaking processes.",
