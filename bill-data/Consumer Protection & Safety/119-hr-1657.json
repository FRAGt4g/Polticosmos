    "summary": "This bill, the Humane Cosmetics Act of 2025, aims to significantly restrict the use of animal testing for cosmetics. It prohibits cosmetic animal testing conducted in the United States and the sale of cosmetics developed with such testing. Exemptions are provided for testing conducted outside the U.S. to meet foreign regulations, testing required by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under specific conditions, testing on products regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and testing for non-cosmetic purposes. The bill also specifies data use limitations and civil penalties for violations, grants the Secretary record access, and preempts state laws relating to cosmetic animal testing. ",
