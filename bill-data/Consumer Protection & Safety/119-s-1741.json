    "summary": "The Truth in Tariffs Act mandates price transparency for consumers in the United States. It requires sellers to clearly display the portion of a good's price attributable to a 'covered tariff,' defined as tariffs imposed by the President on or after January 20, 2025. Small businesses are exempt. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is tasked with enforcement, treating violations as unfair or deceptive practices under the FTC Act, and the FTC is granted rulemaking authority to implement the act.",
