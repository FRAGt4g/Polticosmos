    "summary": "This bill, the Wastewater Infrastructure Pollution Prevention and Environmental Safety Act (WIPPES Act), mandates \"Do Not Flush\" labeling for certain premoistened, nonwoven disposable wipes sold at retail. The labeling requirements vary based on packaging type (cylindrical, flexible film, rigid, and bulk). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is responsible for enforcement, treating violations as unfair or deceptive practices. The bill also preempts state laws regarding \"Do Not Flush\" labeling and defines key terms like \"covered product\" and \"high contrast.\"",
