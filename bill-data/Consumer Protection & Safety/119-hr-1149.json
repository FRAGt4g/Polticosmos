    "summary": "The Protecting Our Wallets from Excessive Rates Act (POWER Act) mandates that retail electric utilities notify consumers of rate increases. It requires utilities to provide detailed explanations of rate increases at least 30 days prior, using multiple communication channels. For planned increases of 5% or more, utilities must notify the Department of Energy (DOE) 60 days in advance, including justification and mitigation plans. The DOE will review, publish findings, and monitor the impacts of the rate increases on consumers. Non-compliance leads to penalties and potential implementation delays.",
