    "summary": "The AI Accountability and Personal Data Protection Act establishes a federal tort for the misuse of personal data. It requires express, prior consent for the appropriation, use, collection, processing, sale, or exploitation of individuals' covered data by any person in interstate or foreign commerce. The bill defines key terms like 'covered data,' 'AI system,' and 'express, prior consent,' and provides for a private right of action for individuals whose data is misused. It also invalidates predispute arbitration agreements and joint-action waivers, requires specific disclosure of third parties when consent is sought, and clarifies its relationship to existing state laws. Those found liable can be subject to damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief. ",
