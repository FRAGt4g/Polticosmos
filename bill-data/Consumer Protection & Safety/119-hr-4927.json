    "summary": "This bill, the Consumer Access to Broadband for Local Economies and Competition Act (or CABLE Competition Act), amends the Communications Act of 1934 to restrict franchising authorities' control over the sale of cable systems. It prohibits authorities from requiring approval for such sales and defines \"transfer of a franchise\" broadly to include mergers, sales, assignments, restructurings, and transfers of control. It mandates fair market value for cable system transfers after franchise revocation and allows for franchise transfers to other operators provided they accept existing terms. The bill includes notification requirements for franchising authorities and sets an effective date six months after enactment.",
