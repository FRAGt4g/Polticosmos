Online retailers must conspicuously display the country of origin and the seller's principal place of business. Exemptions apply to various agricultural products, food and drugs, used items, and small sellers. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will enforce the Act, with safe harbor provisions for retailers and limitations on liability. A Memorandum of Understanding between the FTC, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Department of Agriculture is required.",
