    "summary": "The Business of Insurance Regulatory Reform Act of 2025 aims to clarify the authority of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP) regarding entities overseen by state insurance regulators. The bill amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. It limits the BCFP's enforcement power over insurance businesses, giving more authority to state regulators and broadly construing the enforcement of the title in favor of the state regulators.",
