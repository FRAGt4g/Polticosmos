    "summary": "The Consistent Egg Labels Act of 2025 aims to prevent the mislabeling of egg alternatives. It mandates that any product using the market name of 'egg' or 'egg product' must adhere to the criteria for real eggs and egg products, as defined in federal regulations. The bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include this clarification, orders the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue guidance on enforcement, and requires a report to Congress on actions taken against misbranded products.",
