    "summary": "The Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025 mandates that hotels and short-term rentals clearly and conspicuously display the total price of their services, including all fees, in advertisements and during the booking process. The bill aims to protect consumers from deceptive pricing practices by requiring full price disclosure before purchase. It grants enforcement powers to the Federal Trade Commission and allows state attorneys general to take action. The act also includes provisions for an affirmative defense for third-party online sellers and addresses preemption of state laws.",
