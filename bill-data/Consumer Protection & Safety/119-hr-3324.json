    "summary": "The Safer Shrimp Imports Act amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to mandate inspection of foreign facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding shrimp for U.S. consumption. It requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish agreements with foreign governments to ensure inspections. Shrimp from countries without compliant food inspection systems or cooperation agreements would be refused entry. The bill also specifies criteria for food inspection systems and mandates annual reports to Congress on the implementation of these amendments.",
