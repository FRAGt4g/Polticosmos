    "summary": "The Franchisee Freedom Act (H.R. 4614) aims to protect franchisees. It grants a private right of action to individuals harmed by violations of the Federal Trade Commission's Franchise Rule. This includes the ability to sue for damages, equitable relief (like contract rescission), and attorney fees. Furthermore, the bill prevents franchisors from restricting franchisees' association with each other or participation in trade associations, safeguarding franchisee rights and promoting fair business practices.",
