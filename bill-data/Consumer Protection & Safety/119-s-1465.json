    "summary": "The Credit Access and Inclusion Act of 2025 amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to allow for the reporting of positive consumer credit information related to lease agreements, utility payments (gas, electric, and telecommunications), and outlines limitations on this reporting. It defines terms like \"energy utility firm\" and \"utility or telecommunication firm.\" The bill also protects consumers engaged in payment plans and mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report to assess the impact of these changes on consumers.",
