    "summary": "The \"Ending Scam Credit Repair Act\" (H.R. 306) increases protections against fraudulent credit repair organizations. It prohibits them from collecting fees until providing proof of service with a consumer report issued at least six months later. The bill also bans \"jamming\" (submitting numerous baseless disputes), mandates state licensing by 2026, and enhances consumer disclosures. It establishes statutory damages of $500 per violation and sets new rules for a company's communications and record-keeping to increase transparency and accountability in the credit repair industry.",
