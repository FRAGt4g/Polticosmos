    "summary": "The Data Elimination and Limiting Extensive Tracking and Exchange Act (DELETE Act) mandates the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to establish a centralized system enabling individuals to request the deletion of their personal information from data brokers. Data brokers must register annually, providing information about their data practices. The FTC will create a public, downloadable database of registered brokers. The bill outlines data deletion requirements, including annual audits, and specifies permissible exceptions (e.g., legal compliance, human subjects research). It addresses enforcement, preemption of state laws, and defines key terms related to data privacy. Penalties for non-compliance are detailed.",
