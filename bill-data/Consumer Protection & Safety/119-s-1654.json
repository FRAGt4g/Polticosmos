    "summary": "The Safe and Private Rides Act mandates that transportation network companies (TNCs) like Uber and Lyft inform passengers if a driver's vehicle has a camera recording video. It requires companies to allow passengers to opt out of rides with camera-equipped vehicles. The bill outlines stipulations for opting out, limits liability for TNCs complying with the act, and assigns enforcement to the Federal Trade Commission. It defines key terms like \"transportation network company\" and \"motor vehicle,\" and sets an effective date for the legislation.",
