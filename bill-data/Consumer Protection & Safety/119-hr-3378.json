    "summary": "The Racehorse Health and Safety Act of 2025 aims to protect the health and welfare of racehorses and improve the integrity of horseracing. It authorizes states to form an interstate compact to develop and enforce uniform medication control and racetrack safety rules. The bill repeals the existing Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2020 and establishes a Racehorse Health and Safety Organization (RHSO) to oversee these regulations. It includes provisions for defining key terms, outlining the structure and duties of the RHSO, and addressing rule violations and sanctions.",
