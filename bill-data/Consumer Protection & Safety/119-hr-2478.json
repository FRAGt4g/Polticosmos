    "summary": "The Financial Exploitation Prevention Act of 2025 amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to protect specified adults (65+ or those with impairments) from financial exploitation. It allows open-end investment companies and transfer agents to postpone security redemptions if they suspect exploitation, up to 15 business days, extendable to 25.  Companies must request contact information for designated individuals, and the SEC will issue recommendations on addressing financial exploitation. There are also requirements for internal procedures, record retention, and notification.",
