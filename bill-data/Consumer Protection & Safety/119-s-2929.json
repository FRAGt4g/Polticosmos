    "summary": "The Consistent Egg Labels Act of 2025 aims to prevent the misbranding of egg alternatives. It amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to define what constitutes an egg or egg product, clarifying that it refers to the reproductive output of avian poultry. The bill prohibits the use of egg-related market names for products that don't meet these criteria and mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue guidance on enforcement, including a report to Congress on misbranded products and related actions.",
