    "summary": "The Food Date Labeling Act of 2025 mandates uniform labeling phrases for quality and discard dates on food packaging. It defines 'quality date phrase' as 'BEST If Used By' (or BB) and 'discard date phrase' as 'USE By' (or UB), with exceptions for small packaging. The bill outlines date format requirements, allows for technological enhancements, and mandates consumer education. It preempts state regulations that conflict with these uniform phrases but permits states to regulate based on discard dates. The act amends existing food safety regulations, detailing misbranding violations and establishing deadlines for the Secretaries to coordinate and issue regulations.",
