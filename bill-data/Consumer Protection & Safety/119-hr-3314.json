The bill prohibits the issuance, promotion, or sale of such digital assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is granted exclusive enforcement authority, including the power to impose penalties and seek injunctive relief. The SEC is mandated to create regulations within 180 days of the bill's enactment.",
