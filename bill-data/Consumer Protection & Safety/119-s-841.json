    "summary": "The Romance Scam Prevention Act mandates online dating service providers to notify users if they've received messages from banned members suspected of fraud. Notifications must include banned member details, potential fraud warnings, safety advice, and contact information. The bill outlines notification timing, including delays for law enforcement investigations, and limits provider liability. It grants enforcement powers to the Federal Trade Commission and allows state attorneys general to bring civil actions, while preempting state laws that contradict the federal standard on fraud ban notifications. The act defines key terms like 'fraud ban' and mandates an effective date one year after enactment.",
