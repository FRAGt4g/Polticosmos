    "summary": "This bill, the Unsubscribe Act of 2025, aims to increase consumer protection regarding \"negative options\" (e.g., automatic renewals, free-to-pay conversions). It mandates clear disclosures, express informed consent, limitations on contract durations, easy cancellation mechanisms, and specific requirements for free-to-pay conversions. It empowers the FTC to enforce the act and allows states to bring civil actions while limiting state actions when a federal action is pending. The bill also defines key terms like 'negative option' and 'express informed consent.'",
