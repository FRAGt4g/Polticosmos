    "summary": "The Cosmetic Supply Chain Transparency Act of 2025 aims to improve the safety of cosmetics by enhancing supply chain transparency. It amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by defining key terms like \"brand owner,\" \"ingredient,\" and \"nonfunctional constituent.\" The bill mandates suppliers to provide information to brand owners, requires the FDA to create and maintain a list of nonfunctional constituents subject to testing and disclosure, and establishes penalties for non-compliance. It also outlines procedures for the FDA to update this list and allows for the addition of new lists through a petition process.",
