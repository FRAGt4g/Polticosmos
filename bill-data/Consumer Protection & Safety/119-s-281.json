    "summary": "The Transparency In Charges for Key Events Ticketing Act (TICKET Act) mandates greater transparency in the sale of event tickets. It requires all-inclusive price disclosure (total price displayed upfront), itemized fee breakdowns, and a ban on speculative ticketing (selling tickets the seller doesn't possess). The bill also addresses refund requirements (cancellation/postponement), disclosure of resale status, and restrictions on affiliations with venues/artists. The FTC is tasked with reporting on the enforcement of the Better Online Ticket Sales Act (BOTS Act).",
