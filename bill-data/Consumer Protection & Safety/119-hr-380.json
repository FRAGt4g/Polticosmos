    "summary": "The Affordable Shipping for All Act (H.R. 380) is a bill designed to regulate shipping costs for noncontiguous areas of the United States, such as Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam. It would prohibit shipping services, including private companies and the U.S. Postal Service, from charging higher fees to these areas than for shipping the same product within the contiguous U.S. The act also forbids services from excluding these locations from their shipping policies entirely. An exemption is included for any single product valued at more than $10,000.",
