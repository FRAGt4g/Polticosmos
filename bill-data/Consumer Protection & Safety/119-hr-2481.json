    "summary": "The Romance Scam Prevention Act mandates that online dating service providers notify users if they have received messages from banned members. These notifications must include information about the banned member, potential fraud warnings, safety guidelines, and contact information. The bill also specifies the timing and manner of notifications, provides a safe harbor for providers, and outlines enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general. It establishes a national standard, preempting state laws that conflict with the notification requirements. The Act defines key terms and sets an effective date one year after enactment.",
