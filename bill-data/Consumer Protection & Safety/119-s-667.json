    "summary": "The Safer Shrimp Imports Act amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to mandate inspection of foreign facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold shrimp for U.S. consumption. It requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish agreements with foreign governments and sets criteria for food inspection systems, potentially refusing shrimp imports from countries that fail to comply. The bill also mandates annual reports to Congress regarding implementation.",
