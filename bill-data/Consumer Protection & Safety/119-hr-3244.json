    "summary": "This bill, the Capital Access for Small Businesses Harmonization Act (CASH Act), requires providers of factoring facility agreements to disclose key information to small businesses before entering such agreements. This includes the difference between the face value of a claim and the amount the provider pays, fees, reserves, agreement duration, and an example transaction. It also preempts state laws that impose additional disclosure requirements. The bill defines key terms like \"factoring transaction,\" \"factoring facility agreement,\" \"provider,\" \"reserve,\" and \"small business concern.\"",
