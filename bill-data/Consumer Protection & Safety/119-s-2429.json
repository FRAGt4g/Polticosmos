    "summary": "The \"Stop the Scammers Act\" amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to strengthen consumer protections. It establishes a whistleblower program within the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, offering financial incentives (10-30% of penalties collected) and protections for whistleblowers who provide original information leading to successful enforcement actions against financial wrongdoers.  The bill also clarifies definitions, sets guidelines for award amounts, and limits who is eligible for awards. Additionally, it increases funding for the Bureau.",
