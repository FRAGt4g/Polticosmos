    "summary": "The Stop the Scroll Act mandates that covered platform providers (social media and anonymous content sharing platforms) display mental health warning labels to users in the United States. These labels must warn users about potential negative mental health impacts and provide access to federal resources like the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in collaboration with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will create regulations and enforce the act, with states also having enforcement powers. The bill aims to increase user awareness of the potential harms of social media use.",
