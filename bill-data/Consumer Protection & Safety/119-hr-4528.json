    "summary": "The Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2025 aims to make price gouging unlawful, particularly during periods of exceptional market shock. It grants the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) expanded powers to seek injunctions, civil penalties, and restitution. The bill defines key terms like 'exceptional market shock' and 'unfair leverage,' establishing presumptions of violation based on market behavior. It also mandates disclosures in SEC filings for companies during such shocks, providing details on pricing strategies and profit margins. The Act allows State attorneys general to enforce the law and allocates $1 billion to the FTC for implementation.",
