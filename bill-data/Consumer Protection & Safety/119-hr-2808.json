    "summary": "The Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to limit how consumer reporting agencies furnish reports related to residential mortgage loans. It restricts the sharing of consumer reports requested for a mortgage unless a firm offer of credit or insurance exists, or specific conditions involving the consumer's authorization or relationship with the lender are met. The act defines key terms like 'credit union,' 'insured depository institution,' and others, setting specific limitations on data sharing to protect consumer privacy.",
