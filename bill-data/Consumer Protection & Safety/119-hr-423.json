    "summary": "The Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act of 2025 (H.R. 423) seeks to amend U.S. bankruptcy law to make private student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy proceedings. The bill proposes striking the section of the U.S. Code that currently designates private educational loans as a type of debt that cannot be discharged. By doing so, it would treat private student loans like other consumer debts, such as credit card debt, offering a path to financial relief for borrowers. The change would apply to bankruptcy cases filed after the bill's enactment, while most government-funded loans would remain non-dischargeable.",
