    "summary": "The Alex Gate Safety Act of 2025 mandates the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to create a consumer product safety standard for covered gates (automatic and manual vehicular gates and others exceeding specific dimensions). The bill outlines the required safety standards, referencing existing ASTM and ANSI/UL standards, and details a process for revising these standards. It also requires the CPSC to launch a national education campaign on covered gate safety and submit a report to Congress. The Act defines key terms, including 'covered gate,' 'building official,' and 'local educational agency'.",
