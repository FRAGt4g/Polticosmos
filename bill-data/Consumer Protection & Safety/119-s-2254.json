    "summary": "This bill, the Click to Cancel Consumer Protection Act of 2025, aims to codify the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) negative option rule. This rule, as it existed on July 7, 2025, would be given the force of law, effectively making it a requirement for businesses to have clear and easy-to-use cancellation processes for recurring services or subscriptions. It was introduced in the Senate by Mr. Gallego and Mr. Welch and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.",
