    "summary": "The Pony Up Act requires the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to reimburse citizens for late fees incurred when bills or payments are delayed in the mail. The bill establishes specific criteria for what constitutes a late delivery and outlines a process for citizens to apply for reimbursement online, by mail, or at a post office. It also mandates the USPS to produce annual reports on mail delivery delays and requires the Inspector General to audit whether the USPS prioritizes certain types of mail, aiming to increase transparency and accountability for postal service performance.",
