    "summary": "Tyler's Law mandates that hospitals, medical examiner offices, and coroner offices report to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) incidents involving the death or serious injury of a child associated with children's products or durable infant/toddler products. The bill details the required information for these reports, including incident descriptions, product details, child demographics, and hospital/office involvement. It also amends the Social Security Act regarding Medicare compliance for hospitals and outlines penalties for non-compliance by medical examiner and coroner offices, specifically regarding eligibility for grant programs. The law is to take effect 180 days after enactment.",
