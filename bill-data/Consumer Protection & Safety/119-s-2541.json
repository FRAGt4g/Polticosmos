    "summary": "The Food Date Labeling Act of 2025 mandates uniform labeling for quality and discard dates on food packaging. It defines \"quality date phrase\" (BEST If Used By) and \"discard date phrase\" (USE By), with abbreviations allowed on small packaging.  The bill grants discretion to food label entities regarding date inclusion but standardizes format and requires a consumer education program. It preempts state-specific date labeling regulations while allowing for state laws restricting sale/donation after a discard date. Violations of the act are considered misbranding. It also sets a two year implementation period.",
