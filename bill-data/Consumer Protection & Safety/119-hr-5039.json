    "summary": "The Wheelchair Right to Repair Act aims to ensure independent repair providers and owners of powered mobility assistance devices (wheelchairs and wearable robotic devices) have access to necessary documentation, parts, tools, and software for diagnosis, maintenance, and repair. It amends copyright law to allow circumvention for repair purposes and mandates that manufacturers provide these resources on fair terms. The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general are granted enforcement powers. The bill also defines key terms and protects trade secrets.",
