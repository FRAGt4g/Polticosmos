    "summary": "This bill, the Flood Insurance Consumer Choice Act of 2025, aims to allow National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policyholders to switch to private flood insurance and return to NFIP without penalty. It amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to recognize continuous coverage under private flood insurance policies for regulatory requirements. The bill's core focus is on consumer choice within the flood insurance market and potentially encourages private market participation.",
