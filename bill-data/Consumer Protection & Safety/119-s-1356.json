    "summary": "The 'Trading and Investing with Clear Knowledge and Expectations about Risk Act' (TICKER Act) aims to protect investors from risks associated with investing in consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), particularly those based in foreign jurisdictions. It mandates that national securities exchanges identify VIEs with a specific symbol and requires brokers and dealers to warn investors about the potential lack of legal recourse when investing in these entities. The bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to enforce these requirements.",
