    "summary": "The National Senior Investor Initiative Act of 2025 aims to protect senior investors. It establishes a Senior Investor Taskforce within the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to identify challenges faced by senior investors, address regulatory gaps, and issue reports on these issues. The bill also mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on the financial exploitation of senior citizens, examining economic costs, frequency, and policy responses. The Taskforce will coordinate with other relevant bodies to protect senior citizens, and will sunset (expire) in 10 years.",
