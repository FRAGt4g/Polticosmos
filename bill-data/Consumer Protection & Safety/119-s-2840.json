    "summary": "The Financial Exploitation Prevention Act of 2025 amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to protect specified adults (those 65+ or those with impairments) from financial exploitation. It allows registered open-end investment companies and transfer agents to postpone the redemption of securities if they suspect financial exploitation. Companies must also gather contact information from the customers, notify designated contacts, and establish internal procedures. The bill also requires the SEC to submit a report with recommendations to Congress regarding the financial exploitation of security holders who are specified adults.",
