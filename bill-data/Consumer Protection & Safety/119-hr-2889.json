    "summary": "The Online Consumer Protection Act aims to clarify that violations of terms of service by social media platforms and online marketplaces are considered unfair or deceptive practices, subject to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforcement. The bill mandates clear, machine-readable terms of service, including consumer protection policies, and establishes consumer protection programs for these platforms. It requires annual filings to the FTC from covered entities, allows for individual and state-level enforcement with associated remedies, and prohibits pre-dispute arbitration agreements and pre-dispute joint-action waivers. It also includes provisions for FTC rulemaking and studies on effective communication of consumer protection practices.",
