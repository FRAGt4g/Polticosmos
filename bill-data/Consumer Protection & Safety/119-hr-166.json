    "summary": "The \"Fair Lending for All Act\" seeks to combat credit discrimination by establishing a new Office of Fair Lending Testing within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct proactive, undercover compliance checks. It amends the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) to add sexual orientation, gender identity, and ZIP code as protected classes. The bill also introduces significant criminal penalties for knowing and willful violations, including fines and imprisonment, with personal liability for executives. It broadens the ability to sue for discrimination and expands mortgage data collection to better monitor lending practices.",
