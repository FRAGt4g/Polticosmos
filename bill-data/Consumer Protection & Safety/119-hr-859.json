    "summary": "The 'Informing Consumers about Smart Devices Act' mandates that manufacturers of internet-connected devices disclose, prior to purchase, whether their products contain a camera or microphone. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is responsible for enforcing the Act, treating violations as unfair or deceptive practices. The bill defines \"covered devices\" and outlines exemptions, including phones, laptops, and devices specifically marketed as cameras or microphones. The FTC is required to issue guidance to assist manufacturers in complying with the disclosure requirements, with a focus on clarity and age appropriateness.",
