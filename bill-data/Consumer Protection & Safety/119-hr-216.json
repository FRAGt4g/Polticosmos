    "summary": "The Securities Enforcement Clarity Act of 2025 amends four major U.S. securities laws: the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. The bill seeks to clarify how violations are counted for the purpose of imposing penalties. It stipulates that multiple acts of noncompliance will be considered a single violation if they stem from a common cause, involve the same misstatement or omission, or represent a continuing failure to comply. This would likely limit the ability of regulators to 'stack' penalties for related infractions.",
