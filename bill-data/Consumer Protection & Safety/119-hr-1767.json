    "summary": "The Awning Safety Act of 2025 mandates the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to create a consumer product safety standard for retractable awnings. This standard, expected within 18 months of enactment, aims to protect against death or serious injury risks associated with these awnings, including unexpected opening and related hazards. The bill covers fixed and freestanding retractable awnings within the CPSC's jurisdiction and will be treated as a consumer product safety rule.",
