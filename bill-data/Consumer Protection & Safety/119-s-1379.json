    "summary": "The Right to Equitable and Professional Auto Industry Repair Act (REPAIR Act) aims to ensure consumer access to vehicle data, repair information, and tools. It prohibits manufacturers from restricting consumer choice in vehicle maintenance, including the use of alternative parts. The bill defines various terms related to auto repair, establishes a Fair Competition Advisory Committee, and grants enforcement power to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). It mandates consumer notification of data access and preempts state laws that conflict with its provisions. The Act seeks to foster competition in the automotive repair industry. ",
