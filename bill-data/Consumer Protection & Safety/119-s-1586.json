    "summary": "The App Store Accountability Act aims to protect children by requiring app stores to verify user ages, obtain parental consent for minors, and provide clear information about apps. It mandates age verification at account creation, parental consent for app downloads by minors, and notification of significant app changes. The bill outlines obligations for both app stores and app developers, including data privacy and use restrictions. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is tasked with enforcement, providing guidance, and establishing a compliance certification mechanism. States are also granted enforcement powers. The act includes safe harbor provisions for app developers, preempts state laws, and specifies an effective date.",
