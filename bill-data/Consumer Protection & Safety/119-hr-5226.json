    "summary": "The Deceptive Downsizing Prohibition Act of 2025 aims to protect consumers from 'deceptive downsizing,' where product sizes are reduced while packaging remains the same or similar. The bill directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to create regulations prohibiting this practice. Manufacturers can avoid liability by providing clear notice on packaging about size reductions. Violations are treated as unfair or deceptive acts under existing FTC law, giving the FTC enforcement powers and penalties.",
