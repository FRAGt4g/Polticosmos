    "summary": "This bill, the Financial Empowerment and Protection Act, mandates that covered companies (utilities, internet providers, landlords, mortgage lenders, etc.) allow consenting cohabitating adults to open joint accounts for managing services and bills. It also requires these companies to share account information with both account holders and provide privacy notices.  Furthermore, it amends the Violence Against Women Act to prohibit fees for early lease termination for tenants experiencing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. This aims to protect individual privacy and housing affordability amidst volatile circumstances.",
