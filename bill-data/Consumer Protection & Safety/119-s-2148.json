    "summary": "The 'End Junk Fees for Renters Act' aims to protect renters by prohibiting owners of covered dwelling units from assessing or collecting specific fees. It defines 'covered dwelling units' and 'appropriate regulator' based on housing assistance or federal mortgage backing. The bill bans application fees and tenant screening fees. It limits late fees to less than 3% of monthly rent after a 15-day grace period. Owners must disclose monthly charges, litigation history, maintenance issues, and past rent increases. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and the Federal Trade Commission must define \"junk fee\" and classify reporting unpaid junk fees as unfair debt collection.",
