    "summary": "The TRUTH in Labeling Act (H.R. 4725) mandates enhanced front-of-package nutrition labeling for food products. It requires labels to highlight high levels of added sugars, sodium, and saturated fat, using \"High in\" labels and exclamation point icons, based on Daily Values for different age groups. It also mandates disclosure of non-nutritive sweeteners and a warning against their consumption by children. This aims to improve consumer understanding of food healthfulness and encourage healthier choices, with the Secretary of Health and Human Services responsible for finalizing the relevant rule and updating daily values.",
