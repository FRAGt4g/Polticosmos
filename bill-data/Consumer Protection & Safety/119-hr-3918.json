    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 3918, mandates that short-term rentals be equipped with both smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors. It outlines the prohibition on renting properties without these devices, defines 'short-term rental' and 'covered services', and assigns enforcement to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC is granted the same powers and jurisdiction as under the FTC Act to address violations, treating such violations as unfair or deceptive practices. The requirement takes effect one year after the bill's enactment.",
