    "summary": "The Don't Sell My DNA Act amends Title 11 of the United States Code (Bankruptcy) to protect genetic information. It prohibits the use, sale, or lease of genetic information without explicit, written consent from affected individuals.  The bill mandates prior written notice for such actions and requires trustees in bankruptcy cases to delete genetic information not subject to sale. The amendments apply to pending and future bankruptcy cases, safeguarding genetic privacy during financial hardship.",
