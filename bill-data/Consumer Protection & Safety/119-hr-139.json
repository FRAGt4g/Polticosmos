    "summary": "The Sunshine Protection Act of 2025 seeks to make daylight saving time permanent for the entire nation. The bill would eliminate the biannual changing of clocks by repealing the relevant section of the Uniform Time Act of 1966. It effectively advances the standard time for all time zones by one hour, making what is currently daylight saving time the new, year-round standard. The legislation includes a provision for states and areas that have already opted out of daylight saving time, allowing them to choose whether to adopt the new standard or remain on their current time.",
