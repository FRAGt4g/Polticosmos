    "summary": "The Civil Investigative Demand Reform Act of 2025 aims to reform the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection's (BCFP) process for issuing civil investigative demands. The bill amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to limit the demand period, require specific factual references in demands, establish a process for attorneys to question the BCFP, require confidential treatment for certain petitions, specify grounds for setting aside a demand, and allow for judicial review of denials of petitions to modify or set aside a demand.",
