    "summary": "The Bring Animals Relief and Kibble Act of 2025 (BARK Act) aims to protect individuals, non-profit organizations, and state/local governments from civil and criminal liability when donating pet food and supplies in good faith. The bill defines key terms like 'qualified animal,' 'pet food,' and 'pet supply,' and provides liability protections for donations of 'apparently fit pet-related products' that meet legal standards. It also addresses the handling of pet food and supplies that don't fully meet standards, allowing for reconditioning under specific conditions.  The act aims to promote donations to animals in need while holding donors and distributors accountable for gross negligence or misconduct.",
