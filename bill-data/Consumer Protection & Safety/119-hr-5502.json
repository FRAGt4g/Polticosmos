    "summary": "This bill, the Airline Freeze of Astronomical Increases in Rates Act (AirFAIR Act), aims to prevent excessive airfare price increases during disasters or emergencies. It amends United States Code Title 49, Section 41712 to make it an unfair practice to impose excessive ticket price hikes in such circumstances. The Secretary of Transportation will create regulations to define 'excessive,' with a minimum threshold of a 30% increase. The bill also mandates a study by the Federal Aviation Administration on potential unfair ticket sales practices during emergencies, with a report to Congress within a year.",
