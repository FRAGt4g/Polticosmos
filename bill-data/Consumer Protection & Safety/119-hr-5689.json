It includes working with those facing hardship, modifying loan terms, and preventing negative credit reporting. The bill also requires a post-shutdown report to Congress and updated guidance if necessary. It defines key terms like \"consumers affected by a shutdown\" and specifies which federal agencies are considered \"Federal financial regulators\".",
