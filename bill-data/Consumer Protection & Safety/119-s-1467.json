    "summary": "The Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to limit consumer reporting agencies from furnishing consumer reports related to residential mortgage loans. It restricts access to these reports unless a firm offer of credit or insurance is involved and the requesting party has consumer authorization, originated the consumer's mortgage, services the consumer's mortgage, or is a financial institution holding the consumer's account. This aims to protect consumer privacy in the mortgage application process.",
