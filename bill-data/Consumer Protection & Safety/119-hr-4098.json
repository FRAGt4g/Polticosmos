    "summary": "This bill, the \"Stopping Proxy Advisor Racketeering Act,\" amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to regulate proxy advisory firms. It prohibits these firms from providing proxy voting advice when they have conflicts of interest, such as providing consulting services to the companies they advise on, or basing recommendations on clients' subscription status. The bill defines prohibited conduct, outlines administrative civil penalties, and provides definitions for key terms like \"consulting services\" and \"proxy advisory firm.\" Its goal is to ensure the objectivity and transparency of proxy voting advice.",
