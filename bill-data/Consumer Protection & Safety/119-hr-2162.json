    "summary": "The Honey Integrity Act aims to protect consumers by ensuring the integrity of honey marketed in the United States. It mandates a standard of identity for honey, requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a Honey Integrity Program to detect economically motivated adulteration, and mandates testing of honey by qualifying commercial honey packers. The bill outlines testing protocols, reporting requirements, and enforcement actions, including investigations and data sharing. It also establishes fees and appropriates funding for the program, defining terms like 'economically motivated adulteration' and 'qualifying commercial honey packer'.",
