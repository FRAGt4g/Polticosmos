    "summary": "The \"Preventing Algorithmic Collusion Act of 2025\" aims to prevent anticompetitive conduct in the marketplace facilitated by pricing algorithms. It prohibits the use of algorithms that use nonpublic competitor data, establishes an audit tool for law enforcement, increases transparency in the use of pricing algorithms (requiring disclosures to customers and employees), and provides for enforcement through the Sherman Act and Federal Trade Commission Act. The bill also introduces a presumption of agreement in price-fixing cases involving algorithms and mandates an FTC study on the use of pricing algorithms.",
