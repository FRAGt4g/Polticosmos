    "summary": "The Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2025 mandates that hotels and short-term rentals clearly and conspicuously display the total price of services, including all mandatory fees, in advertisements and during the booking process. The bill grants enforcement powers to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and allows state attorneys general to bring civil actions. It also preempts state laws that conflict with the federal requirements, provides an affirmative defense for intermediaries, and defines key terms like 'covered entity,' 'service fee,' and 'total services price.' The act aims to prevent deceptive pricing practices in the hospitality industry.",
