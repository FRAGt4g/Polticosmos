This revision requires individuals to pass an examination administered by a registered national securities association. The examination will cover topics such as securities types, disclosure requirements, corporate governance, financial statements, risks of unregistered securities, and potential conflicts of interest. The bill aims to ensure a baseline level of financial competency for accredited investors.",
