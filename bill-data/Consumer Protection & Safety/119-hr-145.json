    "summary": "H.R. 145, the 'Risk Disclosure and Investor Attestation Act,' proposes amending the Securities Act of 1933 to broaden investment opportunities. It would allow any individual to invest in private companies, a privilege currently limited mostly to wealthy 'accredited investors.' To qualify, the individual must sign a document, created by the SEC and no longer than two pages, attesting that they understand the risks associated with private investments. The bill aims to democratize access to private markets by shifting the qualification criteria from wealth to an acknowledged understanding of risk.",
