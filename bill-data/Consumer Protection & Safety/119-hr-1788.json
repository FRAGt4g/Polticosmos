    "summary": "The Fair Grocery Pricing Act aims to prevent food producers from using algorithmic systems to artificially inflate prices or reduce food supply. It defines key terms like 'coordinator', 'coordinating function', and 'consciously parallel pricing coordination'. The bill prohibits agreements between food producers and coordinators and outlines enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, the Attorney General, and State Attorneys General. It also allows civil actions by injured parties, invalidates pre-dispute arbitration agreements related to violations, and clarifies its relationship with existing antitrust and other laws.",
