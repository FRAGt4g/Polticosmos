    "summary": "The Payment Choice Act of 2025 mandates that brick-and-mortar retail businesses in the U.S. accept cash payments up to $500 per transaction and prohibits charging cash-paying customers higher prices than those paying by other means. The bill includes exceptions for certain situations, such as temporary payment system failures, and allows businesses to offer cash-to-prepaid card conversion devices under specific conditions. It also grants a five-year period where businesses are not required to accept $50 bills or higher. The bill outlines enforcement through customer complaints, civil actions, and penalties, and requires the FDIC and NCUA to report on ATM locations.",
