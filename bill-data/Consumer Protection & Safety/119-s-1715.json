    "summary": "The 'Protecting Privacy in Purchases Act' (S. 1715) aims to prevent payment card networks and covered entities from using merchant category codes that single out firearms retailers. The bill prohibits assigning distinct codes to firearms retailers compared to general merchandise or sporting goods retailers. It grants the Attorney General enforcement powers, including investigations and the ability to seek injunctions. The bill preempts state and local laws regarding merchant category codes and mandates annual reports to Congress on investigations and effectiveness, but it does not establish a private right of action.",
