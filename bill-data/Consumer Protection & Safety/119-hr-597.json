    "summary": "The Pet Food Uniform Regulatory Reform Act of 2025 (PURR Act) aims to establish a consistent federal regulatory framework for pet food. It grants the FDA authority over pet food labeling, advertising, and ingredient approval, preempting state-level regulations. The bill defines key terms, clarifies GRAS ingredient rules, sets deadlines for ingredient submission reviews, addresses labeling requirements, and prescribes permissible marketing claims. It also assigns responsibilities to the Center for Veterinary Medicine and mandates the issuance of regulations based on AAFCO guidelines.",
