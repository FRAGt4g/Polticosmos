    "summary": "The 'End Junk Fees for Renters Act' aims to protect renters by prohibiting owners of covered dwelling units from charging specific fees. It bans application and tenant screening fees. It regulates late fees, limiting them to 3% of monthly rent and requiring a 15-day grace period. Furthermore, the bill mandates owners disclose critical information to tenants before lease signing, including total monthly costs, past litigation, maintenance issues, and previous rent increases. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and the Federal Trade Commission would define \"junk fee\" and regulate debt collection practices related to such fees.",
