    "summary": "The Genomic Data Protection Act grants consumers the right to access and delete their genomic data, including requesting the destruction of biological samples from direct-to-consumer genomic testing companies. It mandates companies provide clear mechanisms for these actions and sets timelines for fulfilling requests. The bill also addresses notifications required in case of company acquisition and specifies exceptions, such as when data is subject to legal orders. Enforcement falls under the Federal Trade Commission, and the bill preserves existing federal and state laws, only preempting state law in instances of direct conflict.",
