    "summary": "The Payment Choice Act of 2025 mandates that brick-and-mortar retail businesses in the United States accept cash payments up to $500 per transaction and cannot charge cash-paying customers higher prices than those paying with other methods. It provides exceptions for certain situations, outlines enforcement mechanisms, and allows for civil actions against businesses that violate the act. The bill also grants the Secretary of the Treasury rulemaking authority and addresses the acceptance of large bill denominations for a limited time.",
