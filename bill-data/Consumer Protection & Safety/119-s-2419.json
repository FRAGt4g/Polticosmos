    "summary": "The Business of Insurance Regulatory Reform Act of 2025 aims to clarify the authority of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP) regarding entities regulated by state insurance regulators. It amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to limit the BCFP's enforcement power over insurance companies to the extent they are engaged in the business of insurance, and emphasizes the authority of state insurance regulators. The bill also specifies that if the person is subject to any enumerated consumer law or law authorities are transferred under subtitle F or H, the authority of the Bureau to enforce that law with respect to that person shall be narrowly construed to the extent that the person is engaged in the business of insurance.",
