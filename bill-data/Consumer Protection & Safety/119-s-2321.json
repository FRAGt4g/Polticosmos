    "summary": "This bill, the Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2025, aims to outlaw price gouging during exceptional market shocks. It grants the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) expanded powers to seek injunctions, civil penalties, and other relief. It defines key terms like \"exceptional market shock\" and \"unfair leverage,\" sets up presumptions of violation, and allows for an affirmative defense. It mandates disclosures in SEC filings from covered issuers during such shocks and appropriates $1 billion to the FTC for enforcement.",
