    "summary": "The Children Harmed by AI Technology Act (CHAT Act) mandates age verification for users of companion AI chatbots. It requires covered entities (those that own/operate these chatbots) to verify user age, obtain parental consent for minor users, and implement protections like blocking access to chatbots engaging in sexually explicit communication or informing parents of suicidal ideation. The bill also includes requirements for confidentiality of age data, monitoring for suicidal ideation, and notifying users that they are interacting with AI. The Federal Trade Commission will enforce the act. There is a safe harbor for entities acting in good faith.",
