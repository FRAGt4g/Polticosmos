    "summary": "The Bring Animals Relief and Kibble Act of 2025, or the BARK Act of 2025, aims to protect individuals, nonprofit organizations, and state/local governments from civil and criminal liability when they donate pet food and supplies in good faith. The bill clarifies that liability is waived for apparently fit products, even if they don't meet all standards, provided the recipient is informed and can recondition them. Exceptions are made for gross negligence or intentional misconduct. The bill defines key terms like 'pet food,' 'pet supply,' and 'qualified animal.'",
