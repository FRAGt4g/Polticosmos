    "summary": "The 'Improving Disclosure for Investors Act of 2025' mandates the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create rules allowing covered entities (e.g., investment companies, brokers) to deliver regulatory documents electronically to investors.  These rules must include provisions for opting out of electronic delivery, addressing failed deliveries, ensuring readability, and protecting personal information.  The bill also requires the SEC and self-regulatory organizations to review existing rules and adopt consistent regulations, aiming to modernize document delivery and improve investor access to information.",
