    "summary": "This bill, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Stone Slab Products Act, aims to protect manufacturers and sellers of stone slab products (e.g., countertops) from civil lawsuits related to injuries caused by third-party fabricators. It prohibits such actions in both federal and state courts, especially those concerning exposure to silica dust during the alteration of these products. The bill's intent is to prevent frivolous lawsuits, preserve the stone slab product market, protect interstate commerce, and exercise Congressional power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.",
