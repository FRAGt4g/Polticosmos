    "summary": "The Transparency in Enforcement, Restricting, and Monitoring of Services Act (TERMS Act) mandates that online service providers (websites, applications, etc.) disclose their acceptable use policies in a clear and accessible manner. These policies must detail prohibited actions, enforcement processes, appeal options, and how off-platform behavior might lead to account restrictions. The bill also requires providers to provide written notice before terminating or suspending accounts, with exceptions for legal orders or imminent harm, and to publish annual reports detailing their enforcement actions. The FTC is granted enforcement powers and must issue guidance.",
