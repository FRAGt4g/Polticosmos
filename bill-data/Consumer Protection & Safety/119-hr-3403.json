    "summary": "The 'Supporting Equal Access to Tables Act of 2025' aims to regulate third-party restaurant reservation services. It mandates that these services can only list or offer reservations if they have a written agreement with the restaurant or its designated representative. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is empowered to enforce this, treating violations as unfair practices. The bill also prohibits indemnification clauses in agreements, protecting restaurants from liability arising from the reservation service's actions. The act defines key terms, including 'food service establishment' and 'third-party restaurant reservation service'.",
