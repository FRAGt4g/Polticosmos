    "summary": "The Used Car Safety Recall Repair Act prohibits auto dealers from selling, leasing, or loaning used motor vehicles with open safety recalls to consumers. It amends existing federal law to define \"used motor vehicle\" and mandates dealer reimbursement from manufacturers if a remedy for a recall isn't available within a specified timeframe. It sets the reimbursement rate based on the vehicle's fair market value, with a cap, and includes exceptions for wholesale sales and certain recall information unavailability.",
