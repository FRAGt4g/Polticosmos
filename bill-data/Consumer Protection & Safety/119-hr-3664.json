    "summary": "This bill, the Prohibit Auto Insurance Discrimination Act (PAID Act), aims to prevent private passenger automobile insurers from using certain income proxies, such as education level, occupation, and credit score, to determine insurance rates and eligibility. It prohibits these factors and mandates submissions to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to ensure fair practices. It also allows consumer and state actions for violations and outlines enforcement by the FTC, including penalties and regulations. The Act aims to prevent higher rates for lower-income drivers.",
