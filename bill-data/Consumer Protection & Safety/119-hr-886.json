    "summary": "The Beat Bad Bureaucrats Act aims to protect Social Security benefits from garnishment by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for individuals who are victims of identity theft and had covered loans fraudulently taken out in their name. The bill prevents the SBA from garnishing Social Security payments for repayment of the fraudulent loan. The Administrator must revise regulations to include information on how to report identity theft. Covered loans include those made under the Small Business Act and COVID-19 related loans. The act defines terms like 'Administrator', 'covered loan', and 'named individual'.",
