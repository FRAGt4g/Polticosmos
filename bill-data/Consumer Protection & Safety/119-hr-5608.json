    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 5608, aims to allow \"Write Your Own\" (WYO) insurance companies, which currently sell National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policies, to also sell private flood insurance products. It prohibits the FEMA Administrator from restricting these companies, agents, or brokers from offering private flood insurance as a condition of participating in the WYO program. The bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to prevent non-compete clauses. It further prohibits the administrator from including the restricted conditions in future agreements with insurers.",
