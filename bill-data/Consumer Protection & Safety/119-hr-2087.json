    "summary": "The 'Supporting Affordability and Fairness with Every Bet Act of 2025' (SAFE Bet Act of 2025) establishes minimum federal standards for sports betting. It defines terms, outlines state sports wagering program requirements, mandates consumer protections (including self-exclusion lists and affordability checks), and addresses contest integrity. The bill also includes provisions for public health, such as an annual survey on online sports betting, a Surgeon General's report, and surveillance of gambling disorder. Importantly, it mandates data security and real-time information sharing, while also outlining limitations on marketing and licensing requirements. It then covers general provisions, supporting the Federal Government's effort to eliminate unlicensed gambling facilities.",
