    "summary": "The Food Chemical Reassessment Act of 2025 mandates the Office of Food Chemical Safety, Dietary Supplements, and Innovation to regularly reassess the safety of food chemicals. The bill requires reassessments of at least 10 substances (or classes) every three years, starting in 2026. The Secretary of Health is tasked with public notification of findings, and with taking appropriate actions, such as amending or repealing regulations or revoking prior-sanctioned uses, based on reassessment outcomes. The Secretary must also re-establish the Food Advisory Committee to advise on reassessment standards and procedures.",
