    "summary": "The Truth in Tariffs Act mandates transparency regarding the impact of tariffs on consumer prices. It requires sellers to display the portion of a good's price attributable to covered tariffs (imposed on an emergency or discretionary basis by the President, effective January 20, 2025, or later). Small businesses are exempt. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is tasked with creating regulations and enforcing the act, treating violations as unfair or deceptive practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act.",
