    "summary": "The 'Stop Price Gouging in Grocery Stores Act of 2025' aims to protect consumers from unfair pricing practices at retail food stores. It prohibits price gouging (selling items at grossly excessive prices) and surveillance-based price setting. The bill also restricts the use of electronic shelf labels and mandates disclosure of facial recognition technology use. Enforcement is primarily by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), with provisions for state and private actions. It defines key terms like 'grossly excessive price,' and 'surveillance-based price setting' and authorizes appropriations for its implementation.",
