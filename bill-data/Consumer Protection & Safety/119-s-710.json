    "summary": "The Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act of 2025 aims to prevent fraudulent transactions at virtual currency kiosks. It mandates registration of kiosk locations with the Treasury, requires disclosures to customers about transaction terms and risks, and mandates a receipt for each transaction. It also requires operators to implement anti-fraud policies, employ a compliance officer, and use blockchain analytics. Verbal confirmation is required for new customers transacting over $500, along with refund policies for fraudulent transactions. The bill also places limits on transactions with new customers and sets civil penalties for non-compliance.",
