    "summary": "The Default Proceed Sale Transparency Act aims to improve procedures for firearm transfers when the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) hasn't completed a background check. It mandates reporting default firearm transfers within 24 hours and requires the Attorney General to create an online portal and hotline for prioritizing such checks. The bill also prohibits the destruction of records until the background check is complete and mandates annual public reports on default transfers, including data on retrieved firearms and those used in crimes. The Act also calls on ATF to report on the time between transfer and recovery of firearms.",
