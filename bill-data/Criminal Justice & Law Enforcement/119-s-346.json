    "summary": "The Knife Owners' Protection Act of 2025 aims to protect the right of law-abiding citizens to transport knives across state lines. It defines terms like \"State\" and \"transport,\" outlines requirements for knife transportation (including locked containers in vehicles and aircraft), and provides an exception for emergency knives. The bill prohibits arrest or detention of individuals complying with the act, allows this act as a claim or defense, and establishes a right of action for those whose rights are violated. It clarifies that the Act does not limit State law and imposes no additional requirements on air travel with knives.",
