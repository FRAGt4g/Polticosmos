Specifically, it introduces a certification requirement preventing grant applicants and recipients from transferring firearms to or purchasing firearms from licensed dealers on a list of dealers with a high rate of short time-to-crime firearms. The bill also mandates the Attorney General to notify law enforcement agencies about firearms traced to their transfers and to publish a list of covered licensed dealers. Finally, it addresses limitations on public disclosure of Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives database information.",
