Key provisions include phasing out contracts for core correctional services in federal prisons, banning contracts for community confinement facilities with for-profit entities, and requiring the Attorney General to report on prison populations and recidivism reduction programs. The bill also mandates information and counseling for released prisoners on expungement, employment, and social services, as well as annual inspections of facilities used by the United States Marshals Service.",
