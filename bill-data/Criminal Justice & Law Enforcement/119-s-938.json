    "summary": "The Joint Task Force to Counter Illicit Synthetic Narcotics Act of 2025 establishes a joint task force (JTF-ISN) composed of various federal agencies to combat the opioid crisis. The bill defines illicit synthetic narcotics, outlines the Director's responsibilities, and mandates regular reporting to Congress. The JTF-ISN's primary mission focuses on disrupting opioid trafficking, coordinating investigations, enforcing sanctions, and addressing the role of the People's Republic of China. It grants the JTF-ISN authority to investigate and prosecute related federal law violations, while barring it from targeting personal drug use or low-level dealing. The bill also details the internal structure of the JTF-ISN, including intelligence coordination, strategic planning, legal counsel, and congressional coordination.",
