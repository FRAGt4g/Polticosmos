    "summary": "The 'Ending Qualified Immunity for ICE Agents Act' aims to eliminate qualified immunity for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The bill amends Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1983) to specify that acting in good faith or a belief of lawful conduct will not serve as a defense, nor will the argument that rights were not clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. This would make it easier to sue ICE agents for civil rights violations.",
