    "summary": "The Fairness for Crime Victims Act of 2025 aims to prevent Congress from using changes to mandatory spending programs to reduce funding for the Crime Victims Fund. The bill establishes points of order in both the Senate and House of Representatives against legislation that would decrease the amount available for obligation from the Crime Victims Fund below a 3-year average. The bill seeks to ensure consistent funding for victims of crime, particularly those of child abuse, sexual assault, and domestic violence, which the Crime Victims Act of 1984 prioritizes.",
