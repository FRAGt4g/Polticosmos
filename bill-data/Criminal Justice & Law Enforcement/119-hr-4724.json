    "summary": "The Corporate Crime Database Act of 2025 mandates the Director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics to create a searchable, publicly accessible database of corporate offenses. The database will include information on enforcement actions, business entities involved, types of offenses, relevant statutes, and outcomes. Federal agencies will be required to submit information. The Director must also publish an annual report on the data, analyze trends, assess impacts, and recommend actions to improve monitoring and deterrence of corporate offenses. The bill also amends the Chief Data Officer Council's responsibilities to include improving the collection and sharing of information related to corporate offenses by federal agencies.",
