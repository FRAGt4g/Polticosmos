    "summary": "The \"Buzz Off Act\" (H.R. 96) prohibits federal law enforcement agencies from using unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to conduct surveillance on, gather information about, or record a specifically targeted U.S. citizen or their private property. The bill includes specific exceptions to this rule. A drone may be used if the agency obtains a search warrant from a judge, if the citizen provides written consent for public dissemination, or if the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies in writing that it is necessary to counter a high-risk terrorist threat.",
