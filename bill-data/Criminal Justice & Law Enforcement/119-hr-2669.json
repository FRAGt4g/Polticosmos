    "summary": "The Community First Pretrial Reform Act aims to reduce the number of individuals incarcerated in local jails and the length of their incarceration. It authorizes the Attorney General to provide grants to partnerships of local governments, territories, tribes, and nonprofits. These grants support data analysis, strategic planning, and implementation of programs that reduce the use of cash bail, increase pretrial services, and promote diversion programs. Grantees must meet specific requirements, including reducing incarceration rates and addressing equity disparities. The bill outlines grant amounts, selection priorities, and oversight mechanisms, including potential termination of awards for failure to meet reduction targets.",
