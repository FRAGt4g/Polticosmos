Grants are for a 3-year period and include a set-aside for smaller law enforcement agencies. The bill sets matching requirements and includes stipulations around audits, misuse of funds, and required studies. It authorizes appropriations of $24 million annually from 2026-2030, with a termination date of September 30, 2030.",
