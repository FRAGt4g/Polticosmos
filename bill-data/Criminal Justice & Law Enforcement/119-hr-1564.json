    "summary": "This bill, known as Ethan's Law, amends federal law to require secure gun storage to prevent unauthorized access by minors or individuals ineligible to own firearms. It mandates safe storage or the use of safety devices, with penalties for violations, including fines and potential imprisonment if harm results. The bill also establishes a Firearm Safe Storage Program to provide grants to states and tribes that enact similar laws, incentivizing compliance and promoting firearm safety. It also includes a \"Sense of Congress\" clause, stating that failure to comply constitutes negligence and can be considered the proximate cause of harm caused by a firearm discharge.",
