    "summary": "The Strong Communities Act of 2025 amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to allow COPS grant funds to be used for local law enforcement recruits' training at eligible entities (institutions of higher education or local law enforcement agencies) if they agree to serve in their communities. The bill defines eligibility, outlines service requirements (4 years within 8 years in the local area), and specifies repayment obligations if the service commitment isn't fulfilled. It also mandates an annual report to Congress detailing grant recipients, training program participation, and employment retention data.",
