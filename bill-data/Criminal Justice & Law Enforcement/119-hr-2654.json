    "summary": "The 'Lifesaving Gear for Police Act of 2025' aims to restrict the enforcement of federal regulations limiting the transfer of federal equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies. It prevents the use of federal funds to implement unenacted regulations related to such transfers. The bill mandates the return or re-issuance of equipment recalled or seized under these regulations if certain conditions are met, ensuring agencies regain access to the equipment. It also puts limits on future executive orders about equipment transfer.",
