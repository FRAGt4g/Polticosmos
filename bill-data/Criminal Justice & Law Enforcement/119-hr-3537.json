    "summary": "The 'Targeting Child Predators Act of 2025' amends Title 18 of the United States Code concerning administrative subpoenas. It introduces a certification process for nondisclosure requirements attached to certain subpoenas, primarily those related to child predator investigations. The bill provides for judicial review of these nondisclosure requirements, allowing recipients to challenge them in court. It outlines conditions for when nondisclosure is warranted (e.g., to protect lives, prevent flight, or preserve evidence). The Act specifies the procedures for this judicial review, including limitations on hearing access and record sealing, and allows for extensions of nondisclosure orders.",
