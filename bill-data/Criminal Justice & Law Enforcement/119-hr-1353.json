    "summary": "The Justice for Murder Victims Act aims to eliminate any statute of limitations on federal homicide offenses. It amends Chapter 51 of title 18 of the United States Code to prevent dismissal of homicide prosecutions based solely on the time passed between the act causing death and the victim's death. This bill seeks to ensure that perpetrators of homicides are held accountable regardless of the time elapsed.",
