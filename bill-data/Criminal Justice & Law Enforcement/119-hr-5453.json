    "summary": "The 'Responsible Retirement of Law Enforcement Firearms Act of 2025' amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, primarily focusing on the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program.  It introduces a certification requirement, preventing grantees from purchasing firearms from, or transferring firearms to, 'covered licensed dealers' identified by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). These dealers are defined by the number of firearms traced to them that were used in crimes. The bill also mandates the public disclosure of certain ATF database information and amends previous legislation to allow for this disclosure.",
