    "summary": "The 'Protecting Communities and Preserving the Second Amendment Act of 2025' addresses gun violence through several measures. It strengthens the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), increases penalties for firearms violations, and establishes a task force focusing on illegal gun purchases by felons and fugitives. The bill also mandates reports to Congress on gun-related prosecutions, increases federal prosecution of gun violence, and tackles mental health issues within the criminal justice system. Additional provisions cover interstate firearm transport, prevent duplicative grants, and establish regional firearms trafficking task forces.",
