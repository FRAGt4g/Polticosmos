    "summary": "The Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act (HALT Fentanyl Act) permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I controlled substances, establishing a broad chemical definition to cover future analogues. The bill applies severe penalties for trafficking these substances. In parallel, it aims to facilitate scientific study by creating an expedited registration process for researchers working with Schedule I substances. It streamlines requirements for institutions, allows for single registrations for multiple research sites, and clarifies rules for manufacturing small quantities for research purposes, balancing stricter enforcement with the need for medical and scientific research.",
