    "summary": "H.R. 60, the \"Knife Owners\u2019 Protection Act of 2025,\" seeks to protect the right of individuals to transport knives across state lines. It preempts varying state and local laws by establishing a federal standard for secure transportation. The bill permits individuals, not otherwise prohibited by federal law, to transport knives between places where possession is legal, provided the knives are stored in a locked container or, in a vehicle, are inaccessible from the passenger compartment. It creates legal protections against arrest and allows individuals to sue for damages if their rights under the act are violated.",
