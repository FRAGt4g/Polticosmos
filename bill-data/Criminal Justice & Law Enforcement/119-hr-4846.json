    "summary": "This bill, the \"Reinstating Orderly Access for Drivers Act\" (ROAD Act), amends Title 18 of the United States Code to provide an affirmative defense in criminal or civil actions related to motor vehicle incidents. Specifically, it allows a defense if the injury or damage was sustained by a participant in a riot, provided the participant has been convicted of rioting or the crime can be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. It also allows for the court to stay the civil action pending the criminal case.",
