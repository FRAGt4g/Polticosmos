    "summary": "The FIREARM Act aims to protect firearm licensees from license revocation or denial based on certain violations. It defines terms like \"self-reported violation\" and \"uncorrectable violation.\" Crucially, it mandates the Attorney General to provide licensees with an opportunity to correct violations and provides instructions to avoid future violations unless the violation cannot be corrected, or involves a prohibited transfer or acute risk of harm. The bill also allows judicial review of license revocations and applies retroactively to licenses revoked under the Enhanced Regulatory Enforcement Policy, offering affected licensees a chance to reapply.",
