    "summary": "The 'Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act of 2025' aims to repeal sections of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. This means it removes legal protections for gun manufacturers and sellers and allows for the discoverability and admissibility of gun trace information from the ATF's Firearms Trace System database in civil proceedings. This would make it easier to bring lawsuits against gun manufacturers and sellers.",
