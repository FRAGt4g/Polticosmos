    "summary": "The Cell-Site Simulator Warrant Act of 2025 seeks to regulate the use of cell-site simulators (devices that mimic cell towers) by law enforcement and the intelligence community. The bill requires warrants for most uses, outlines exceptions for emergencies and national security, establishes rules for evidence admissibility, prohibits certain uses, and mandates reporting by Inspectors General.  It amends existing laws like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and regulates how information from cell-site simulators can be used and handled.",
