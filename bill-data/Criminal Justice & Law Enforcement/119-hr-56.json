    "summary": "The 'Secret Service Prioritization Act of 2025' transfers the U.S. Secret Service's financial crime investigation functions to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These responsibilities include investigating counterfeiting, financial institution fraud, and access device fraud. The bill's purpose is to allow the Secret Service to prioritize its core protective mission, amending its authority to focus on arresting those who threaten protected officials. It outlines a framework for the transition, detailing the transfer of assets, personnel, and obligations, while ensuring continuity for pending cases and administrative actions.",
