    "summary": "The Pathways to Policing Act (H.R. 3408) authorizes grants to states, local governments, and law enforcement agencies to encourage recruitment of law enforcement officers. Funds can be used for marketing and recruitment campaigns (up to 50%) and Pathways to Policing programs (up to 50%), which help candidates facing barriers enter law enforcement. The bill prioritizes applicants recruiting from underrepresented communities and those willing to serve in the communities they live in or near. It also mandates the Attorney General develop nationwide marketing campaigns. The bill authorizes $100 million in appropriations annually for fiscal years 2026-2030, $50 million for grant programs and $50 million for the national campaign.",
