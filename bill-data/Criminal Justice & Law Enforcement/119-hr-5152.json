    "summary": "The BOP Release Card ID Act of 2025 mandates the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to issue photo identification release cards to US citizen prisoners upon release. These cards, valid for at least 18 months, must meet REAL ID Act standards. The bill requires the Director of the BOP to negotiate with states to accept these cards for state-issued IDs and lists various federal programs and agencies where the card must be accepted as proof of identity. The Attorney General is also required to provide guidance to states regarding the issuance of similar cards for state prisoners.",
