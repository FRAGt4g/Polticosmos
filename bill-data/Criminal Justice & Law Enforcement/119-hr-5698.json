    "summary": "The District of Columbia Clemency Home Rule Act (H.R. 5698) grants the District of Columbia the authority to determine how clemency is granted for crimes committed under its laws. It defines clemency as including pardons, reprieves, sentence commutations, and financial penalty remissions. The bill ensures that the authority will be exercised according to DC law, and clarifies that the President or Mayor's pre-existing clemency powers are unaffected until new DC laws are created. The legislation applies retroactively.",
