    "summary": "The Carla Walker Act establishes a grant program to improve forensic activities, specifically focusing on DNA analysis and forensic genetic genealogy. It amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to eligible entities (states, law enforcement agencies, etc.) for conducting advanced DNA analysis, purchasing forensic equipment, and outsourcing analysis. The bill details application processes, permissible uses of grant funds, reporting requirements, and mandates a Department of Justice report on the program's effectiveness and best practices for implementing these technologies.",
