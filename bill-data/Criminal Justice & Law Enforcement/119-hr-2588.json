    "summary": "The bill, titled the Improving Reporting to Prevent Hate Act of 2025, amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. It mandates the Attorney General to evaluate whether jurisdictions credibly report hate crimes to the FBI. Jurisdictions failing to credibly report may lose grant eligibility, unless they conduct public education and awareness initiatives. The Attorney General will publish an annual report on compliant jurisdictions. Key definitions include 'covered jurisdiction,' 'hate crime,' and 'community initiatives.'",
