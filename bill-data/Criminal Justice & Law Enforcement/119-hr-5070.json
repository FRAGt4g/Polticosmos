    "summary": "This bill, the Federal Police Camera and Accountability Act, mandates that federal law enforcement officers wear body cameras and that patrol vehicles are equipped with in-car video recording. It outlines requirements for activation, deactivation, notification, and limitations on the use of these recording devices. The bill sets standards for footage retention, public access to the footage (with exceptions), and prohibits the use of facial recognition technology. It also includes stipulations for use of force investigations. Furthermore, it calls for a GAO study and requires the Attorney General to issue regulations.  Failure to follow these rules could result in disciplinary action against officers and evidence being deemed inadmissible.",
