    "summary": "This bill, the \"Defund Cities that Defund the Police Act of 2025,\" aims to prevent jurisdictions that \"defund\" their police departments from receiving federal economic development and community development block grants. It defines \"defunding State\" and \"defunding locality\" based on actions like abolishing or significantly reducing police budgets. The bill amends existing legislation overseeing grant programs, making defunding jurisdictions ineligible for certain funds and outlining reallocation procedures for returned funds.",
