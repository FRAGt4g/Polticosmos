    "summary": "This bill, the Agent Raul Gonzalez Officer Safety Act, targets individuals who flee from pursuing federal officers while operating a motor vehicle within 100 miles of the U.S. border. It imposes criminal penalties, including imprisonment and fines, with harsher penalties for offenses resulting in serious bodily injury or death. The bill also amends immigration law, making those convicted of or admitting to such offenses inadmissible, deportable, and ineligible for immigration relief. Additionally, it mandates an annual report to Congress detailing violation statistics and penalties.",
