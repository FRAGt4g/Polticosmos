    "summary": "The Gun Trafficker Detection Act mandates the reporting of lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement within 48 hours for non-licensed owners. It requires the Attorney General to create a web portal for reporting and notify local authorities. The bill amends existing laws to include penalties for non-compliance and prohibits firearm receipt for repeat offenders. It also directs the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to account for the new regulations. Amendments are made to existing laws to incorporate the new provisions and the act takes effect 90 days after enactment.",
