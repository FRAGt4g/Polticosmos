    "summary": "The Court Shopping Deterrence Act aims to change how nationwide injunctions are appealed. The bill amends Title 28 of the United States Code to direct that appeals of district court orders granting nationwide injunctions go directly to the Supreme Court. A nationwide injunction, as defined in the bill, is an order that restricts the enforcement of a federal law (statute, regulation, etc.) against a non-party. The bill's stated intention is to deter forum shopping by directing appeals to the highest court.",
