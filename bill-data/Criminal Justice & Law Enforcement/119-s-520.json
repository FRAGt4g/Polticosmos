    "summary": "The 'SALONS Stories Act' (S. 520) amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. It aims to increase federal grants to states that mandate domestic violence prevention training for cosmetologists and barbers. The training must cover recognizing, responding to, and referring clients experiencing domestic violence. The bill authorizes $5 million annually from 2027-2033 for these grant increases and limits the duration of the grant increases for each state to one year, potentially renewed for a maximum of 3 years. This bill also defines 'qualifying training' and 'eligible State'.",
