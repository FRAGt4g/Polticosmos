    "summary": "The Gun Records Restoration and Preservation Act aims to repeal several provisions related to firearms regulation. It seeks to remove restrictions on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), including limitations on data collection and analysis, the processing of Freedom of Information Act requests, and physical inventory checks of firearms dealers. It also aims to eliminate the requirement to destroy instant criminal background check records within 24 hours. The bill cites several studies and statistics related to gun violence and trafficking, arguing that the changes would support law enforcement and improve public safety.",
