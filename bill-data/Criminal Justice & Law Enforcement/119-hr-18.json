    "summary": "The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2025 (H.R. 18) seeks to expand federal background check requirements to most firearm transfers between private individuals. It would mandate that such transfers be facilitated through a licensed firearms dealer, who must conduct a background check on the recipient. The bill includes several exemptions for specific situations, such as bona fide gifts between close family members, temporary transfers for hunting or at a shooting range, and temporary possession to prevent imminent harm. The legislation explicitly states that it does not authorize the creation of a national firearms registry.",
