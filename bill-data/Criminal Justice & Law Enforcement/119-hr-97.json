    "summary": "This bill, the 'Injunctive Authority Clarification Act of 2025,' seeks to amend U.S. law to prohibit federal courts from issuing 'national injunctions.' It would prevent a court from issuing an order that restrains the enforcement of a law or regulation against anyone not directly involved in the case (a non-party). The bill's intent is to limit the scope of judicial injunctions so they only apply to the specific parties in a lawsuit. An exception is made for representative actions, such as class-action lawsuits, where parties formally represent the interests of non-parties.",
