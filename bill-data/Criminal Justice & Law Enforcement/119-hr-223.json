    "summary": "H.R. 223, the \"Preventing Unjust Red Flag Laws Act of 2025,\" seeks to prohibit the use of federal funds for the implementation or enforcement of \"red flag laws.\" The bill would prevent any federal department or agency from using its budget for federal red flag laws and also forbids providing federal financial assistance to state, local, tribal, or territorial governments for their red flag programs. The legislation defines a \"red flag law\" as a temporary, risk-based protective order that permits the removal of a firearm from an individual \"without due process.\"",
