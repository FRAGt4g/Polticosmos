The bill mandates a new jury hearing if the initial jury cannot unanimously agree on a sentence (death, life imprisonment, or a lesser sentence) for a defendant convicted of a crime punishable by death. If the second jury also fails to reach a unanimous decision, the court must impose a sentence other than death.\n",
