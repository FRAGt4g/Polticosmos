    "summary": "The Cell-Site Simulator Warrant Act of 2025 aims to regulate the use of cell-site simulators (devices that mimic cell towers) by law enforcement and the intelligence community. The bill requires warrants for the use of such devices, outlines exceptions for emergencies and research, mandates disclosures about potential disruptions for commercial mobile services, and establishes oversight and reporting mechanisms. It also amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and includes provisions for civil actions and administrative discipline related to violations. The bill has an effective date two years after enactment, with a possible extension for existing cell-site simulator models.",
