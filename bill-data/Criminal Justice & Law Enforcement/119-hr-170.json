    "summary": "The 'USPS Subpoena Authority Act' (H.R. 170) seeks to expand the administrative subpoena power of the U.S. Postal Service. It would authorize the Postmaster General to issue subpoenas for records and testimony during investigations into 'covered offenses.' These include postal crimes, mail fraud, and the use of mail for activities violating the Controlled Substances Act, such as drug trafficking. This enhances the investigative capabilities of the Postal Inspection Service. The bill also limits the authority to approve such subpoenas to high-level officials like the USPS General Counsel or the Chief Postal Inspector.",
