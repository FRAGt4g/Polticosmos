    "summary": "The 'Silencers Help Us Save Hearing Act' (SHUSH Act) aims to treat firearm silencers (suppressors) similarly to firearm accessories. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the National Firearms Act, and Title 18 of the United States Code. Key provisions include removing silencers from federal regulation as firearms and preventing states from imposing taxes or registration requirements on silencers. It also removes silencers from definitions related to penalties and exemptions for law enforcement regarding concealed carry and exempts silencers from Consumer Product Safety Commission regulation.",
