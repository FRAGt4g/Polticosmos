    "summary": "H.R. 393, the \"No Repeat Child Sex Offenders Act,\" proposes a significant increase in penalties for federal crimes against children. The bill amends numerous sections of Title 18, U.S. Code, covering offenses such as sex trafficking, transportation of minors, exploitation, and sexual abuse. For these crimes, the legislation systematically replaces existing sentencing guidelines, including specific term limits and fines, with a uniform, severe penalty of death or life imprisonment. This aims to create a stricter punitive framework for individuals convicted of committing or facilitating sexual crimes against children.",
