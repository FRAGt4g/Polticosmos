    "summary": "The Restoring Artistic Protection Act of 2025 (RAP Act) aims to limit the admissibility of a defendant's creative or artistic expression as evidence in court. It amends the Federal Rules of Evidence to generally exclude such expression, with exceptions where the government can prove, through clear and convincing evidence, that the expression directly relates to the alleged crime and has unique probative value. The bill defines \"creative or artistic expression\" broadly, covering various art forms. It emphasizes court rulings on the record, redaction, and limiting instructions to the jury.",
