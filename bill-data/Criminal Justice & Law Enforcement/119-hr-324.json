    "summary": "The PPP Shell Company Discovery Act directs the Treasury Secretary to compile a comprehensive list of all Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan recipients, to be shared with the IRS and Department of Justice. The bill also mandates the IRS to create specific lists of potentially fraudulent recipients for criminal investigation. These lists would identify recipients who had no employee payroll tax withholdings in 2019 or whose loan amount was disproportionately large compared to their reported wages, aiming to uncover fraud committed by entities like shell companies that received government aid.",
