    "summary": "The Interstate Transport Act of 2025 aims to protect the right of law-abiding citizens to transport knives across state lines, overriding local and state restrictions. It defines 'transport' broadly and outlines conditions for knife transport, including locked container requirements for motor vehicles and other transport modes.  The bill includes provisions for emergency knives, protects individuals from arrest when complying with the law, and addresses legal costs and expungement of records for prevailing parties. It clarifies that the act doesn't limit existing state laws.",
