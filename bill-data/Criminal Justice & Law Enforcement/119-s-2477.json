    "summary": "The \"End Solitary Confinement Act\" aims to eliminate the use of solitary confinement in federal agencies and entities, establishing minimum standards for out-of-cell time and meaningful human engagement. It mandates access to congregate activities, restricts the use of solitary confinement to specific emergency situations and medical purposes, and institutes due process protections. The bill also establishes a community monitoring body, requires reporting on incidents, provides for a private right of action for violations, and creates state incentives to end solitary confinement, along with definitions and revisions to standard operating procedures. The bill also includes guidelines regarding restraints, administrative measures, and a prohibition on the use of appropriated funds for certain correctional facility upgrades.",
