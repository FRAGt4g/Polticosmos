    "summary": "The Trafficking Survivors Relief Act of 2025 aims to provide relief to victims of human trafficking with federal criminal records. It allows for the vacating of convictions and expungement of arrests for certain offenses if those offenses were directly related to the victim being trafficked. The bill also introduces a human trafficking defense, creating a presumption of duress for individuals charged with federal offenses who were victims of trafficking. It mandates reports and training related to human trafficking indicators.  The bill also clarifies post-conviction relief and aid access for trafficking victims.",
