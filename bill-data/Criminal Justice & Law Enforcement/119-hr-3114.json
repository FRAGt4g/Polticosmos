It applies to individuals not classified as sex offenders who were arrested but not convicted, or convicted of specific nonviolent offenses involving marijuana, after fulfilling their sentence. The bill also allows for petition-based sealing of certain other nonviolent offenses. It defines eligibility, outlines procedures, provides for court hearings and consideration of public safety, and offers employer immunity. The act covers exceptions for law enforcement access and sets penalties for unauthorized disclosure.",
