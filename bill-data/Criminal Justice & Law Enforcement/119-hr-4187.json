    "summary": "The Stop Hate Crimes Act of 2025 (H.R. 4187) amends Title 18 of the United States Code to clarify the causation element in the federal hate crime statute. It focuses on how much a victim's protected characteristics (race, religion, etc.) must contribute to an injury. Specifically, the bill replaces phrases like \"because of\" with \"if\" and introduces the concept that the victim's protected characteristic \"was a contributory motivating factor\" for causing the injury. The bill aims to strengthen the legal framework surrounding hate crimes.",
