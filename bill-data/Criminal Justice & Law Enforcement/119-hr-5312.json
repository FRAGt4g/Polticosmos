    "summary": "This bill, the Judicial Accountability for Irresponsible Leniency Act (JAIL Act), allows individuals harmed by repeat offenders released on bail pending trial to sue the judge or government entity responsible. It specifically targets judges and entities that release defendants charged with violent crimes who have prior violent crime convictions. The bill removes judicial immunity in these cases and defines key terms like \"covered defendant\" and \"crime of violence.\"",
