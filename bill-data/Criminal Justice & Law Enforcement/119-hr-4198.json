    "summary": "The Clean Hands Firearm Procurement Act requires the Attorney General to publish a list of federally licensed firearms dealers with a high number of firearms traced to crimes within a short time frame ('time-to-crime'). Federal agencies are prohibited from contracting with dealers on this list. The Attorney General can waive this prohibition for national security reasons (with notification to relevant congressional committees). The Act defines 'covered firearms dealer' based on trace data and sets effective dates.",
