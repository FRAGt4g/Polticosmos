    "summary": "The 'States Handling Access to Reciprocity for Employment Act of 2025' (SHARE Act) amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to facilitate the sharing of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal history record information between the FBI and state licensing authorities. This sharing is for conducting background checks on individuals applying for licenses to practice professions in compact member states, as required by interstate compacts. The bill restricts the use of this information to only the licensing purpose and defines key terms like 'Commission,' 'Criminal history record information,' and 'License.'",
