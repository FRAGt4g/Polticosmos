    "summary": "This bill, the Stop Sexually Violent Predators Act (H.R. 779), aims to increase protections against sexually dangerous individuals. It amends the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, requiring states to submit lists of convicted offenders to the Attorney General, allowing for federal prosecution review. It restricts federal funding for healthcare (Medicaid and Medicare) for specified individuals convicted of sexually violent offenses, with exceptions for inpatient care. Finally, it increases SORNA reporting requirements by adding information about relevant court cases.",
