    "summary": "This bill, the Background Check Point of Contact Act of 2025, establishes a grant program through the Department of Justice to incentivize states to create point-of-contact systems for firearm sales. These systems would allow licensed gun dealers to verify the legality of a sale or transfer, and require a state-issued approval number for transactions. States conforming to the requirements would receive grants and must publish annual reports detailing investigations, appeals, and system functionality. The bill also mandates annual audits of the state systems by the FBI.",
