    "summary": "The \"End Endless Criminal Statutes Act\" is a bill that seeks to repeal or amend several federal laws that create what it deems to be unnecessary criminal offenses. The bill identifies a list of outdated or trivial actions that carry federal criminal penalties, such as writing a check for less than $1, sledding on Capitol grounds, and placing mail in a mailbox without postage. It repeals the specific U.S. Code sections corresponding to these offenses and also amends the law against wearing a postal carrier's uniform to require criminal intent for prosecution.",
