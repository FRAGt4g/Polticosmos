    "summary": "The Restoring Law and Order Act of 2025 proposes to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. It establishes a grant program administered by the Attorney General for law enforcement agencies. These grants would fund initiatives to hire and retain officers, combat vehicle theft and violent crime, use pretrial detention, target drug and fentanyl crimes, detain/deport criminal illegal aliens, eliminate investigatory backlogs, and combat child trafficking. The bill sets appropriations and rescissions, effectively redirecting funds from diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.",
