It mandates an administrative relief process for individuals whose applications are denied, including the right to appeal and receive attorney fees for successful appeals. The bill also sets deadlines for ATF to process applications, deeming them approved if not acted upon within three business days. Additionally, the bill requires reports on unresolved NICS checks and a memorandum of understanding between ATF and the FBI regarding NICS administration.",
