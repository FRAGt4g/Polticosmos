    "summary": "The Cellphone Jamming Reform Act of 2025 aims to allow state and federal correctional facilities to use cell phone jamming equipment. The bill specifies that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) cannot prevent this. It defines key terms like \"commission\", \"correctional facility\", and \"jamming system.\" It also includes requirements such as limiting the system's operation to housing facilities, funding responsibilities for state facilities, and consultations with local law enforcement. The bill's intent is to curb illicit communications within correctional settings.",
