    "summary": "This bill, the \"District of Columbia Prosecutor Home Rule Act,\" transfers the authority to prosecute local D.C. crimes from the federal U.S. Attorney's Office to a new local prosecutor's office designated by District of Columbia law. This act aims to increase D.C.'s self-governance, or \"home rule,\" over its own criminal justice system. It does not affect the prosecution of federal laws. The bill also contains provisions ensuring that employees who transfer from the U.S. Attorney's office to the new local office retain their federal employment benefits for a smooth transition.",
