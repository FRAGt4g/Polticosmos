    "summary": "The 'Prosecutors Need to Prosecute Act of 2025' mandates that certain district attorney and prosecutor offices report annually to the Attorney General, detailing the number of cases involving specific offenses (murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, arson, and firearm-related offenses) referred for prosecution, declined for prosecution, subject to plea agreements, and subject to diversion. The bill also prioritizes federal funding for local governments that comply with reporting requirements and establishes uniform reporting standards. Furthermore, it prevents the Attorney General from distributing Byrne-JAG funds to jurisdictions that prohibit cash bail for firearm-related offenses.",
