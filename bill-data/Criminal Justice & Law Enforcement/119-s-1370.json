    "summary": "The Gas-Operated Semi-Automatic Firearms Exclusion Act (GOSAFE Act) aims to restrict the possession of certain gas-operated semi-automatic firearms and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices. It defines \"gas-operated\" firearms and creates a list of prohibited firearms by the Attorney General. The bill prohibits the import, sale, manufacture, transfer, receive, or possess of these firearms, with some exceptions, and increases penalties for violations. It also allows for gun buy-back programs and creates a Firearm Safety Trust Fund.  Manufacturers can seek approval for new designs. ",
