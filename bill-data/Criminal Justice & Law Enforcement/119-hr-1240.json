    "summary": "The National Statistics on Deadly Force Transparency Act of 2025 mandates the Attorney General to create regulations for collecting and compiling data on the use of deadly force by law enforcement. This includes details on the incident, involved individuals (excluding personally identifiable information), and the law enforcement agency's justification. The Bureau of Justice Statistics will make the data public (excluding private information), and states failing to comply with the reporting requirements face a 10% reduction in Byrne JAG grant funding.",
