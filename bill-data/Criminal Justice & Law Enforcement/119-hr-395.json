    "summary": "The Justice for Rape Survivors Act (H.R. 395) proposes to amend Title 18 of the United States Code to establish stricter penalties for federal sexual abuse crimes. The bill specifically targets sections 2241 (Aggravated sexual abuse) and 2242 (Sexual abuse), replacing the current sentencing guideline of \"any term of years or life\" with a mandatory minimum sentence of \"not less than 30 years or for life.\" This change would require a minimum 30-year prison term for individuals convicted of these offenses, aiming to ensure more severe and consistent punishment for perpetrators.",
