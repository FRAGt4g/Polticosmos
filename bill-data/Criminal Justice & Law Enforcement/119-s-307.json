The Inspector General will then analyze updated data on such incidents from 2022-2025 and provide Congress and the Attorney General with an analysis and recommendations. The Attorney General is required to establish national standards for prevention, reduction, and punishment of these offenses. The bill aims to improve data collection, mitigate incidents, and ensure the safety of correctional officers and other BOP employees.",
