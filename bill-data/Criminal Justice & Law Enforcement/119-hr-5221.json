    "summary": "The 'Preventing Auto Recycling Theft Act' (PART Act) aims to curb catalytic converter theft. It mandates the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to include catalytic converters in motor vehicle theft prevention standards, requires marking of catalytic converters with unique identifiers linked to a database accessible by law enforcement, and establishes a grant program for VIN stamping. It also requires enhanced record-keeping for businesses handling catalytic converters and introduces criminal penalties for theft and trafficking of these parts.",
