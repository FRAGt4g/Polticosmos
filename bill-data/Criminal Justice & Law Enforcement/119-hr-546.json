    "summary": "The 'Investing in Safer Traffic Stops Act of 2025' proposes a grant program to fund local, State, or Tribal government entities. The grants would be used to ensure traffic violations are enforced by civilians or traffic monitoring technology, rather than law enforcement officers. The Attorney General is tasked with establishing the program within 180 days of enactment. The bill authorizes appropriations of $100 million annually from 2026-2031. Civilians are defined as government employees who are not law enforcement officers.",
