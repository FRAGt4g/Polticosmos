Additionally, the bill aims to rescind any unspent federal funds previously allocated to the office and requires it to reimburse the federal government for all funds it has received and expended since January 1, 2021. The legislation, introduced by Representative Biggs, seeks to financially penalize this specific local prosecutor's office through federal action.",
