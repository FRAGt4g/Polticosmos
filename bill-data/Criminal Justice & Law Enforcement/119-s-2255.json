    "summary": "The Trafficking Survivors Relief Act of 2025 aims to provide relief to victims of human trafficking. It allows for the vacating of convictions and expungement of arrests for certain offenses if the crimes were a direct result of being a trafficking victim. The bill also introduces a 'human trafficking defense' based on duress, allows for sentence reduction, requires reports on the use and impact, and ensures confidentiality. Additionally, it clarifies grant usage for post-conviction relief representation and emphasizes the importance of addressing the changing tactics of human traffickers.",
