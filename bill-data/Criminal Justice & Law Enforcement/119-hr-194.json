    "summary": "The \"VENUE Act\" (H.R. 194) amends federal law to change the trial location for certain offenses committed on federal property within the National Capital Region (D.C. and specified surrounding counties in Maryland and Virginia). Under this bill, indictments would be filed in the defendant's home judicial district rather than where the crime occurred. If the defendant's residence is unknown, the case may be filed in the District of Columbia. The bill also grants defendants the right to request a transfer to their home district and applies to pending cases without a scheduled trial.",
