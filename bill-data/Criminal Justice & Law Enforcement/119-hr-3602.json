    "summary": "This bill, the Ending Qualified Immunity Act (H.R. 3602), aims to eliminate the defense of qualified immunity for government officials in civil rights lawsuits filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. It argues that the current interpretation of qualified immunity, established by Supreme Court rulings, has frustrated the original intent of the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act by limiting the ability of plaintiffs to recover damages when their constitutional rights are violated by state and local officials. The bill amends section 1983 to explicitly state that good faith, reasonable belief of lawfulness, and lack of clearly established rights are not defenses in such cases.",
