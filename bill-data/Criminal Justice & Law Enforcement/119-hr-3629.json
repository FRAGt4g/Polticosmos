    "summary": "The 'End Banking for Human Traffickers Act of 2025' aims to increase the financial industry's role in combating human trafficking. It mandates the Financial Institutions Examination Council to review and enhance procedures for detecting and reporting financial transactions related to human trafficking. It also requires the Interagency Task Force To Monitor and Combat Trafficking to analyze anti-money laundering efforts and make recommendations to strengthen these efforts, including changes to training, information sharing, and potentially, existing laws. The bill also amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 to include a framework for preventing financial transactions involving the proceeds of human trafficking.",
