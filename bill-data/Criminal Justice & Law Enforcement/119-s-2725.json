    "summary": "The 'STOP Act 2.0' aims to combat the flow of illicit substances through international mail. It increases penalties for mail fraud involving misrepresentation of origin, and terminates the authority to exempt countries from providing advance electronic information for all mail shipments, five years after enactment. The bill also mandates annual reports on compliance, promotes public-private partnerships, encourages international collaboration on information sharing, trains U.S. Customs officers, and requires an evaluation of the original STOP Act's implementation.",
