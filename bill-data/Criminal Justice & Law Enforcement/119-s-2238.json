    "summary": "The Preventing Auto Recycling Theft Act (PART Act) aims to reduce catalytic converter theft. It mandates the marking of catalytic converters on vehicles, establishes a grant program for VIN stamping, regulates the purchase and sale of these parts (requiring traceable payments), and increases criminal penalties for theft and trafficking related to catalytic converters. The bill amends existing federal regulations and statutes (Titles 18, 49, and 17 of the United States Code) to achieve these goals.",
