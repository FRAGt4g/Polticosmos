    "summary": "The Litigation Reimbursement Act directs courts to award attorney's fees in criminal cases that do not result in a conviction. It amends existing law to mandate the award of fees in such cases, replacing the previous discretionary language. It also amends provisions related to civil cases, requiring the award of costs and fees rather than permitting it.",
