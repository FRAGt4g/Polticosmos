    "summary": "This bill, the Statutes of Limitation for Child Sexual Abuse Reform Act, aims to incentivize states to eliminate statutes of limitations for child sexual abuse cases. It mandates the elimination of state civil and criminal statutes and the revival of previously time-barred civil claims. The bill also authorizes grants to states that eliminate these statutes and provides funding for said grants through fiscal years 2026-2033. It focuses on amending the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to achieve these goals.",
