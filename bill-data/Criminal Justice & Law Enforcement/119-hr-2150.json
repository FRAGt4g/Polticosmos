    "summary": "The bill, known as the TRACE Act, mandates the Attorney General to add a data field to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). This field will indicate if a missing person's last known location, or the location of unidentified remains, was confirmed or suspected to be on federal land. The bill also requires an annual report to Congress, disaggregating the data by the Federal land management agency with jurisdiction. The goal is to improve tracking of missing persons and unidentified remains on federal lands.",
