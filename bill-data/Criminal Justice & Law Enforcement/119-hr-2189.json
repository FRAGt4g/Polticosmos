    "summary": "The Law-Enforcement Innovate to De-Escalate Act of 2025 aims to modernize federal firearms laws. It focuses on exempting certain less-than-lethal projectile devices from existing restrictions. The bill defines \"less-than-lethal projectile device\" and outlines a process for the Attorney General to determine if a device meets this definition. The goal is to provide law enforcement with updated tools while minimizing the risk of serious injury or death.",
