    "summary": "This bill, the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement Act of 2025 (VISIBLE Act), mandates that immigration enforcement officers visibly display their agency affiliation and identifying information (name or badge number) during public-facing actions. It defines covered officers and public enforcement functions, specifies requirements for identification display (size, visibility), and addresses non-medical face coverings. The bill also establishes internal accountability measures, including disciplinary actions for non-compliance, and requires the Department of Homeland Security to submit annual reports to Congress detailing enforcement activities, compliance rates, and disciplinary actions. Furthermore, it tasks the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties with investigating public complaints and issuing recommendations.",
