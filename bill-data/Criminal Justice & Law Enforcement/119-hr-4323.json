    "summary": "The Trafficking Survivors Relief Act of 2025 aims to provide relief to victims of human trafficking with federal criminal records. It allows for the vacating of convictions and expungement of arrests for certain offenses if the crimes were a direct result of the person being a trafficking victim. The bill also introduces a human trafficking defense in federal prosecutions, permitting defendants to claim duress. It mandates reports and training related to human trafficking, and allows for sentence reduction. The bill focuses on providing post-conviction relief and protecting victims' rights.",
