    "summary": "The Epstein Files Transparency Act mandates the Attorney General to publicly release unclassified documents related to Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days of the Act's enactment. This includes records from the Department of Justice, FBI, and US Attorneys' Offices. The bill outlines specific categories of information to be released, such as investigations, flight logs, and communications. It prohibits withholding information based on embarrassment or political sensitivity. Permitted withholdings are narrowly defined, focusing on victim privacy, child sexual abuse materials, active investigations, and national security concerns. The Attorney General must submit a report to Congress detailing released and withheld records, redactions, and a list of implicated government officials. The Attorney General is required to declassify, or in certain instances release unclassified summaries.",
