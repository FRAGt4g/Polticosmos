    "summary": "The Justice for Murder Victims Act aims to eliminate the statute of limitations for federal homicide offenses, allowing prosecution regardless of the time elapsed between the act causing death and the death itself. It includes provisions for death penalty applicability, limiting it to cases where death occurs within a year and a day of the act. The bill also amends existing law to reflect these changes regarding sentencing and time limitations.",
