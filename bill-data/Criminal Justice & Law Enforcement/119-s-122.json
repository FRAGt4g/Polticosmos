    "summary": "The Qualified Immunity Act of 2025 seeks to codify qualified immunity for law enforcement officers in actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The bill defines \"law enforcement agency\" and \"law enforcement officer.\" It specifies conditions under which an officer cannot be found liable, such as if the right violated was not clearly established or if a court previously upheld the officer's conduct. It also addresses the liability of law enforcement agencies and local governments. The amendments take effect 180 days after enactment.",
