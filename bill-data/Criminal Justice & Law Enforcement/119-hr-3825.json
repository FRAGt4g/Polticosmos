    "summary": "The Kelsey Smith Act amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require providers of telecommunications services to disclose user location information to law enforcement or public safety answering points in emergency situations involving risk of death or serious physical harm, or in response to a 9-1-1 call. The bill outlines the conditions for disclosure, specifies record-keeping requirements for law enforcement agencies, provides liability protection for service providers, and clarifies the relationship to existing state law. It defines 'covered service' and 'investigative or law enforcement officer.'",
