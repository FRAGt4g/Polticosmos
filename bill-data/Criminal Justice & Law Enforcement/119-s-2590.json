    "summary": "The Fresh Start Act of 2025 proposes a grant program for states to modernize criminal justice data infrastructure. These grants, up to $5 million per state, aim to facilitate automatic record expungement and sealing. States must have covered expungement laws and not require fee payment for expungement. The bill outlines application requirements, permissible grant uses (research, planning, and implementation of infrastructure improvements), reporting requirements on expungement data (disaggregated by race, ethnicity, and gender), and a public report from the Attorney General. It authorizes $50 million annually from 2026-2030 to fund this program.",
