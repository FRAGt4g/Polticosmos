    "summary": "The Prosecutors Need to Prosecute Act amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. It requires district attorney offices in large jurisdictions (serving over 380,000 people) that receive Byrne grants to submit annual reports to the U.S. Attorney General. These reports must include data on serious criminal cases, such as the number of cases declined for prosecution, details on plea agreements, and recidivism information for defendants. The Attorney General is mandated to standardize reporting, publish the information publicly online, and submit it to the congressional Judiciary Committees to increase transparency.",
