    "summary": "The 'No Federal Funds for Political Prosecutions Act' prohibits State and local law enforcement agencies from using funds or property received through federal equitable sharing and asset forfeiture programs to investigate or prosecute a current or former President, Vice President, or a candidate for President. To receive these funds, agencies must certify their compliance to the Attorney General. The bill authorizes the Attorney General to disqualify non-compliant agencies from receiving any future forfeited property or proceeds from the federal government, effectively creating a financial penalty for what it terms 'political prosecutions'.",
