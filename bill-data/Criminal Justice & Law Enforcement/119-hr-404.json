    "summary": "The \"Hearing Protection Act\" seeks to deregulate firearm silencers by removing them from the purview of the National Firearms Act (NFA). This bill amends federal law to treat silencers as standard firearms, not NFA-regulated items. This change would replace the current $200 tax stamp and lengthy registration with a standard background check process, similar to buying a rifle. The act also mandates the destruction of existing silencer registration records, preempts certain state-level taxes and registration rules, and applies a 10% federal excise tax on silencer sales, aligning their tax treatment with other firearms.",
