    "summary": "The 'Rape Shield Enhancement Act of 2025' directs the Judicial Conference to submit a report to Congress examining potential amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. These amendments would aim to further limit the admissibility of evidence regarding an alleged victim's sexual behavior or predisposition and enhance privacy protections for such evidence. This includes narrowing scope of discovery requests and establishing clearer protections against subsequent disclosures of personal information, all in the context of sexual assault cases.",
