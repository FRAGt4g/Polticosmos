It amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to establish a grant program administered by the Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Grants will be awarded to states, local governments, tribes, and community organizations to establish ACE response teams. These teams will implement protocols, develop partnerships, integrate services, provide training, and offer technical assistance to support children exposed to trauma. The bill authorizes $10 million in funding annually from 2026-2029.",
