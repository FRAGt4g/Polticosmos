    "summary": "The Parity for Tribal Law Enforcement Act amends the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act to enhance public safety in Indian communities. It grants tribal law enforcement officers, who meet specific training and background requirements, the authority to enforce federal law within their jurisdiction. The bill also deems these officers as federal law enforcement officers for certain legal purposes and mandates the Department of Justice to coordinate and oversee public safety initiatives in Indian communities, including training, data analysis, and reporting to Congress.",
