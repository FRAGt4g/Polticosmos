    "summary": "The Pardon Transparency and Accountability Act of 2025 mandates the President to publicly release a written explanation for all pardons granted, including publication in the Federal Register and on the President's website. It requires the Pardon Attorney to prepare a Justice Impact Statement, including victim contact and impact assessments, and mandates notification of the Pardon Attorney upon consideration of executive clemency. The bill also amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to increase transparency around lobbying efforts related to potential pardons, mandating registration and reporting. Finally, the bill requires the Pardon Attorney to conduct regular studies on compliance with the Act, reporting findings to Congress.",
