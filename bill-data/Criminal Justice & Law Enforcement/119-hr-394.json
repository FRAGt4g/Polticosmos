It amends three sections of Title 18 of the U.S. Code (1466A, 2252, and 2252A) related to obscenity, exploitation material, and pornography material involving minors. The bill replaces existing penalty structures with a uniform punishment for violators, who would be subject to a fine and sentenced to death or life in prison.",
