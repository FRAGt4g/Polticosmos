    "summary": "This bill, the Diversion And Rehabilitation Transformation Act of 2025 (DART Act), aims to reduce crime and recidivism by expanding and enhancing pre-incarceration diversion and rehabilitation programs at the state and local levels. It amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act to allow Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program funds to be used for these programs, including pre-arrest and post-release initiatives, specialty courts, and trauma-informed practices. The bill also mandates the establishment of a National Diversion and Rehabilitation Clearinghouse to disseminate information on evidence-based practices.",
