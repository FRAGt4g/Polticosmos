    "summary": "The Lawless Cities Accountability Act of 2025 aims to prevent federal funds from being allocated to jurisdictions deemed \"lawless\" by the Attorney General. A lawless jurisdiction is defined as one that restricts law enforcement intervention, withdraws protection from certain areas, disempowers or defunds law enforcement, or refuses federal assistance during widespread violence. The Attorney General must regularly identify such jurisdictions, and funding can be restored after a period or once the jurisdiction is no longer deemed lawless.",
