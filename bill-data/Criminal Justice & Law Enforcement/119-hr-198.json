To be eligible for funding, jurisdictions must allow courts to consider an individual's danger to the community when setting bail. They must also have recently taken steps like enacting such a bail law, increasing hiring of police and prosecutors, or running public campaigns to improve police-community relations. The bill authorizes $10 million annually from FY2026 to FY2031, with the funds intended for uses outlined in the Second Chance Act.",
