    "summary": "The Facial Recognition Act of 2025 seeks to regulate law enforcement's use of facial recognition technology. It defines terms like \"facial recognition\" and \"face surveillance,\" restricts the use of such technology without warrants (with exceptions for emergencies), mandates data logging and public reporting, and requires accuracy and bias testing. The bill also establishes civil rights and civil liberties protections, including prohibiting the use of facial recognition for face surveillance and immigration enforcement. It outlines penalties for violations and grants individuals the right to sue for misuse of the technology.  Additionally, the bill tasks NIST with developing best practices and standards for facial recognition.",
