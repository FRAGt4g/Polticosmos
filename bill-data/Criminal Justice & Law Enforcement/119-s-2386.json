    "summary": "The bill, titled the Preventing Authoritarian Policing Tactics on America\u2019s Streets Act, aims to limit the use of federal law enforcement for crowd control. It mandates clear identification for officers and prohibits the use of unmarked vehicles. It restricts crowd control authority to federal property, except under specific circumstances like a state/local request for assistance or the invocation of the Insurrection Act. It also limits arrest authority if officers violate the bill's provisions and requires public notice of deployments, including locations and mission details.",
