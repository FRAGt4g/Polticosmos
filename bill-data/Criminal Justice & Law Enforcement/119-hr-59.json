    "summary": "The Mens Rea Reform Act of 2025 amends federal law to establish a default mental state requirement for criminal offenses. For any federal crime that does not specify a required state of mind (mens rea), this bill mandates that prosecutors must prove the defendant acted \"knowingly\" to secure a conviction. The legislation defines terms like \"knowingly\" and \"willfully\" and is intended to protect individuals from being convicted of offenses they were unaware they were committing. It includes exceptions for jurisdictional elements and cases where it would lower existing standards set by Supreme Court precedent.",
