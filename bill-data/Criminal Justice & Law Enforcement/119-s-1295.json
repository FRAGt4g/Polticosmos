    "summary": "This bill, the \"BOP SCAN Mail Act,\" mandates the Director of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to develop and implement a strategy to intercept fentanyl and other synthetic drugs in mail entering federal correctional facilities. The strategy requires evaluation of existing interdiction technologies and a plan for digital mail scanning, ensuring inmates receive digital copies of mail within 24 hours and physical copies within 30 days. It also outlines considerations for staff protection, legal mail processing, equipment and technology budgets, and contractor oversight. Implementation must be completed within three years of the strategy's submission, contingent on appropriations, with annual progress reports required.",
