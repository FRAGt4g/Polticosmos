    "summary": "The 'No Funding for Lawless Jurisdictions Act' proposes amendments to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. It restricts federal grants to states and local governments that limit cash bail for all covered offenses, or permit pretrial release on personal recognizance for previously convicted felons. Additionally, it prohibits grants to covered jurisdictions (urbanized areas) that reduce law enforcement agency budgets, unless the reduction is part of a broader, proportional budget shortfall.",
