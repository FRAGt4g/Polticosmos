    "summary": "This bill, the \"Restoring Executive Power To Appoint United States Attorneys Act of 2025,\" aims to amend Title 28 of the United States Code. It focuses on restoring executive power to appoint United States attorneys. The bill specifically amends section 546 of the code, removing subsections (c) and (d) and replacing them with language allowing an appointed United States attorney to serve until a President-appointed attorney is qualified. This effectively gives the President more control over these positions.",
