    "summary": "The Fire Sale Loophole Closing Act of 2025 aims to restrict the transfer of firearms held as business inventory when a Federal firearms license is revoked or its renewal denied. It prohibits transferring these firearms into personal collections, to employees, or to certain individuals. After revocation or expiration, the bill further limits transfers to other persons, except for licensed dealers or law enforcement, and introduces a one-year waiting period before transferring a firearm moved to a personal collection. It defines \"business inventory firearm\" and includes provisions for penalties and notice requirements.",
