    "summary": "This bill, the \"Preserving Safe Communities by Ending Swatting Act of 2025,\" aims to penalize individuals who make false communications intended to provoke an emergency response (e.g., SWATting). It amends Title 18 of the United States Code to address this issue by defining and criminalizing such behavior. It increases penalties based on the severity of the consequences, including bodily injury or death, and allows for civil actions to recover expenses incurred during an emergency response. The bill seeks to deter and punish actions that put public safety at risk.",
