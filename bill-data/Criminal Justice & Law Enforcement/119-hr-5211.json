    "summary": "The Peace Officer Standards and Training Agency Information Access Clarification Act aims to authorize peace officer standards and training agencies to access criminal history records. The bill amends Section 534 of title 28, United States Code, to explicitly include these agencies among those authorized to receive such information from the FBI.  It also defines 'peace officer standards and training agency' and mandates that the Attorney General update relevant regulations within 180 days of the bill's enactment.",
