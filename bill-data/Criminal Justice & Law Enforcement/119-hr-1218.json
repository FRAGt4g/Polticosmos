It defines terms like 'intimate visual depiction,' 'communications service,' and outlines penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and forfeiture of assets. The bill makes exceptions for law enforcement, legitimate reporting, and service providers. It also addresses threats related to non-consensual image distribution and provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction.",
