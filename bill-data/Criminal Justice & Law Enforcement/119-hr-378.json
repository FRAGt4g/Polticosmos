    "summary": "The 'Thin Blue Line Act' (H.R. 378) proposes amending U.S. federal law to introduce a new aggravating factor for consideration when imposing the death penalty. This new factor would apply in cases where a defendant killed or attempted to kill a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responder. The bill specifies that this aggravating circumstance is applicable if the victim was targeted while performing their official duties, because of their duties, or due to their status as a public official, thereby making such crimes more likely to receive a capital punishment sentence.",
