    "summary": "This bill, the \"Ending Qualified Immunity Act\", aims to remove the defense of qualified immunity for government officials in civil rights lawsuits brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. It argues that qualified immunity, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, has undermined the intent of the original legislation (Ku Klux Klan Act) and hampered the ability of individuals to seek redress for violations of their constitutional rights by state and local officials. The bill amends section 1983 to explicitly state that factors such as good faith, reasonable belief of lawfulness, and lack of clearly established rights are not defenses in such cases.",
