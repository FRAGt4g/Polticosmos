    "summary": "This bill, the Comprehensive Health and Integrity in Licensing and Documentation Act of 2025 (or CHILD Act of 2025), aims to amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993. It focuses on ensuring that organizations working with vulnerable populations (e.g., children) can conduct background checks on their contractors, as well as individuals they license or certify to provide care. The amendments include expanding the definition of individuals subject to background checks to encompass those employed by, volunteering with, or seeking to be employed by or volunteer with entities under contract with a qualified entity, and those licensed or certified by a qualified entity.",
