    "summary": "The Federal Prisons Accountability Act of 2025 aims to increase oversight of the Bureau of Prisons. It mandates that the Director of the Bureau of Prisons be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The bill also specifies a 10-year term limit for the Director, with a provision for holdover service until a successor is confirmed. The act highlights the Bureau's large budget and the significant responsibilities of the Director, arguing for Senate confirmation to increase accountability.",
