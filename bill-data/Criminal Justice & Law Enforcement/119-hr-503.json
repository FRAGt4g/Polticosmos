    "summary": "The Qualified Immunity Act of 2025 seeks to codify the defense of qualified immunity for law enforcement officers in actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. It stipulates that an officer is not liable if the right violated wasn't clearly established or if a court previously ruled the conduct lawful. The bill defines \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d and \u201claw enforcement agency,\u201d and states that if the officer is not found liable, the employing agency also isn't liable. The amendments take effect 180 days after enactment.",
