    "summary": "The Protect Our Letter Carriers Act of 2025 aims to enhance the safety of postal workers. It calls for upgrading collection boxes with high-security features and replacing older mailbox keys with electronic versions, allocating $1.4 billion annually from 2026-2030 for these upgrades. The bill also urges the Attorney General to vigorously prosecute assaults against postal employees and mandates the appointment of Assistant U.S. Attorneys to coordinate investigations related to offenses against the U.S. Postal Service. Furthermore, it directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend sentencing guidelines to treat the assault or robbery of a postal employee similarly to the assault of a law enforcement officer.",
