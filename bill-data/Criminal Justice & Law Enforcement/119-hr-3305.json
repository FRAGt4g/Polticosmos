    "summary": "The LEO Fair Retirement Act of 2025 aims to amend Title 5 of the United States Code to address retirement benefits for federal law enforcement officers. It proposes including overtime hours, not compensated due to pay limitations, in the calculation of their annuities. The bill allows officers to make lump-sum payments to account for the uncompensated overtime. It also extends availability pay to more federal employees and provides a tax credit for the lump-sum payments. The bill covers both CSRS and FERS retirement systems.",
