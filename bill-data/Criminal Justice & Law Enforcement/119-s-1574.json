    "summary": "The Tribal Access to Electronic Evidence Act amends the Stored Communications Act to include Tribal courts as courts of competent jurisdiction. This allows Tribal courts to issue warrants for electronic evidence, mirroring existing procedures for federal and state courts. The bill also updates definitions related to governmental entities and Indian Tribes, ensuring they are included in the legal framework. Furthermore, it specifies warrant procedures for Tribal courts and makes related changes to sections concerning the disclosure of customer communications, delayed notice, civil action, and wrongful disclosure of video records.",
