    "summary": "The 'No More Narcos Act' aims to prevent minors from working with cartels and transnational criminal organizations. It mandates the Attorney General, in collaboration with other agencies, to establish an informational campaign educating students near the U.S.-Mexico border about the dangers of such involvement. The Secretary of Homeland Security will implement a national strategy to combat cartels targeting and recruiting minors for illegal activities. The bill also amends the DOJ Assets Forfeiture Fund to allow payments for the informational campaign and national strategy.",
