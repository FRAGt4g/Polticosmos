    "summary": "The Pregnancy Resource Center Defense Act aims to increase penalties for attacks on facilities offering alternatives to abortion and places of religious worship. It modifies existing federal law (18 U.S. Code \u00a7248 and \u00a7844(i)) to provide stricter criminal penalties, including longer prison sentences, and increased civil remedies, such as higher fines for those who damage, threaten, or obstruct these facilities. The bill explicitly targets actions against facilities exclusively providing abortion-alternative services and houses of worship.",
