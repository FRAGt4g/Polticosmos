    "summary": "The ATF Transparency Act aims to increase transparency and fairness in firearm transfer application processes. It mandates the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to establish an administrative relief process for denied applications, including appeals and the ability to provide information to prevent future erroneous denials. It also sets deadlines for application processing, deeming applications approved if the ATF fails to make a decision within 90 days. Furthermore, the bill requires reports on unresolved NICS checks and a memorandum of understanding between the ATF and the FBI regarding NICS inquiries.",
