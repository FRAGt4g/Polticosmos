    "summary": "The 'Protecting Our Children in an AI World Act of 2025' amends Title 18 of the United States Code to address child pornography created using artificial intelligence. It eliminates a specific affirmative defense in such cases and broadens the definition of \"sexually explicit conduct\" to include simulated obscene exhibitions. The bill emphasizes that if any part of the act is found unconstitutional, the remaining parts remain in effect.",
