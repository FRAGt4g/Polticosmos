    "summary": "This bill, the Guarding Unprotected Aging Retirees from Deception Act (GUARD Act), aims to combat elder financial fraud, pig butchering, and general financial fraud. It allows state, local, and tribal law enforcement to use federal grant funds to investigate these crimes, including hiring personnel, providing training, and obtaining technology. The bill also mandates reports on the use of these funds, the state of scams in the US, and requires federal agencies to assist law enforcement with tracing tools for blockchain technology. Additionally, it directs reports to Congress on the current scam landscape and how different agencies are addressing these issues.",
