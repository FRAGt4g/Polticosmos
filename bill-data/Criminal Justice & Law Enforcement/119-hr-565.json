    "summary": "This bill, the \"District of Columbia Federal Judicial Officials Residency Equality Act of 2025,\" amends Title 28 of the U.S. Code to change residency requirements for federal judicial officials in D.C. It eliminates existing exemptions that allow D.C. Circuit and District Judges, U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshals, and court clerks to live outside the District. By removing these exceptions, the bill mandates that these officials reside within the District of Columbia, aligning their requirements with those in other jurisdictions. The new rules would only apply to individuals appointed after the bill's enactment.",
