    "summary": "The Births in Custody Reporting Act of 2025 mandates that states report anonymized and aggregate information to the Attorney General regarding pregnant inmates and those who give birth while in custody. The bill requires quarterly reports detailing pregnancy outcomes, medical care, restraint usage, and placement in restrictive housing. The Attorney General will publish these reports, conduct a study on the data collected, and report findings to Congress within two years. States failing to comply face potential funding reductions.",
