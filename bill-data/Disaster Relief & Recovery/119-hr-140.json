    "summary": "This bill, the 'Hurricane Helene and Milton Tax Relief Act of 2025,' provides financial assistance to individuals impacted by these hurricanes in presidentially-declared disaster areas. It allows affected taxpayers to use their prior year's income to calculate the Earned Income Tax Credit, which could increase their refund. It also increases the deduction limit for charitable contributions made for hurricane relief. The act permits penalty-free withdrawals of up to $100,000 from retirement accounts, with options to spread the tax burden over three years or repay the amount. Additionally, it eases rules on retirement plan loans.",
