It mandates 100% federal matching payments for medical assistance during relief periods and allows for expanded coverage options, like extended mental health services and home and community-based services, and streamlines application processes. The bill also provides guidance and assistance to states in responding to increased demand for medical assistance and establishes an HCBS emergency response corps grant program.",
