    "summary": "This bill, the Tornado Observations Research and Notification Assessment for Development of Operations Act (TORNADO Act), aims to improve tornado forecasting, warning communication, and post-storm assessments. It directs the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere to improve communication of hazardous weather risks, establish research programs, including a pilot program for tornado hazard communication, and develop a strategic plan for high-resolution probabilistic forecasts. It also addresses tornado rating systems, post-storm surveys, and amends the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 to improve the VORTEX-USA program. Finally, it mandates a Government Accountability Office report on the National Weather Service's IT infrastructure for alert dissemination and eliminates certain report requirements.",
