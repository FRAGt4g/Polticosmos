    "summary": "This bill, the FEMA Temporary Housing Assistance Improvement Act, amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The primary purpose is to clarify that the President cannot consider insurance a duplication of benefits when determining eligibility for temporary housing assistance. This means individuals with insurance coverage can still receive federal aid for temporary housing after a disaster.",
