    "summary": "The Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act (S. 1619) mandates the establishment of an online subpage within an existing government website to increase transparency regarding Federal disaster assistance. This subpage will publish information about disaster assistance, including total amounts, expenditure details on projects, and project specifics like names, descriptions, and locations. It defines key terms like \"covered Federal agency,\" \"disaster assistance,\" and \"eligible recipient.\" The bill directs the Office of Management and Budget to coordinate with relevant agencies and may involve a private entity to build the subpage.",
