    "summary": "The bill, titled the FEMA for America First Act of 2025, amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. It restricts eligibility for certain FEMA assistance provided to individuals, limiting it to \"qualified aliens\" as defined by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, with specific exclusions for asylum seekers, refugees, and parolees who haven't sought permanent residency. The bill aims to prioritize aid for U.S. citizens and legal residents during disaster relief.",
