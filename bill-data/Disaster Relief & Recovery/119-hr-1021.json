    "summary": "The Small Business Disaster Damage Fairness Act of 2025 aims to amend the Small Business Act. It increases the minimum disaster loan amount for which the Small Business Administration (SBA) may require collateral, from $14,000 to $50,000. The bill also mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the performance of SBA loans, including default rates, and requires the SBA to distinguish between rural and urban communities in its outreach and marketing for disaster assistance programs, incorporating actions to mitigate challenges for rural communities, aligning with recommendations from a GAO report.",
