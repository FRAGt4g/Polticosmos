    "summary": "The Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide tax relief for individuals affected by major disasters and wildfires.  It codifies and extends rules for personal casualty losses arising from major disasters, including a \"qualified disaster loss\" deduction. It also excludes from gross income compensation for losses or damages resulting from certain wildfires, specifically those declared after December 31, 2014, with provisions to prevent double benefits.  The provisions related to disaster losses apply to losses in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, and wildfire compensation applies to payments received after December 31, 2025, and before January 1, 2031.",
