    "summary": "The \"Protecting Homeowners from Disaster Act of 2025\" (H.R. 481) is a bill that proposes an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Its primary goal is to provide greater financial relief to individuals who suffer property losses from disasters. The bill would repeal the current limitation on tax deductions for personal casualty losses. This change would allow taxpayers to deduct losses from events like fires, floods, or storms, regardless of whether the event occurs in a federally declared disaster area. The amendment is intended to apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
