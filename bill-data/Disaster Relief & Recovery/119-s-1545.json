    "summary": "This bill, the Repeatedly Flooded Communities Preparation Act, amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to address areas repeatedly damaged by floods. It mandates that communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program identify and assess flood risks, develop mitigation plans, and make these plans publicly accessible. The Administrator of FEMA is empowered to provide data and mitigation grants to assist communities. It also allows for sanctions, including suspension from the flood insurance program, for non-compliance and requires reports to Congress. The aim is to increase community accountability and reduce the impact of flooding.",
