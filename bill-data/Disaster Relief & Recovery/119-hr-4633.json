    "summary": "The 'Upending Secret Postal Shutdowns Act' amends Title 39 of the United States Code to establish procedures for post offices suspending operations due to emergencies. It mandates public notification of suspensions, including reasons, interim solutions, and expected end dates. It requires notification of relevant public officials (Members of Congress and local government heads).
