    "summary": "The Emergency Rural Water Response Act of 2025 aims to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to broaden eligibility for emergency water assistance grants. It expands the scope of grant usage to include water resources infrastructure like potable water, wastewater, storm drainage, and solid waste facilities. Additionally, it increases the population threshold for certain grant eligibility.  The bill also exempts portable water treatment and filtration facilities from NPDES permit requirements for six months following a state-declared disaster, to facilitate emergency response.",
