    "summary": "The Western Wildfire Support Act of 2025 aims to improve federal activities related to wildfires. It covers preparation (reporting, reimbursements for military-caused fires, strategic planning), wildfire detection and suppression support (equipment, unmanned aircraft systems), and post-fire recovery support (online guides, BAER Teams, burned area rehabilitation, and a prize for invasive species reduction). The bill amends existing legislation and creates new programs to address wildfire prevention, management, and recovery efforts.",
