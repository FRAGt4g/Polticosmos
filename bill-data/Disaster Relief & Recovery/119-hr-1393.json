    "summary": "The Wildfire Response Improvement Act directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to improve wildfire response. It mandates a review of criteria for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of wildfire mitigation projects, including pre-calculated benefits, nature-based infrastructure, vegetation management, public health impacts, and water infrastructure. FEMA is required to issue updated guidance based on the review. The bill also addresses fire management assistance program eligibility and amends the Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide to include guidance on wildfire-specific recovery challenges.",
