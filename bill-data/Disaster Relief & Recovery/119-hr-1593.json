    "summary": "The Disaster Displacement Assistance Improvement Act of 2025 aims to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. It mandates that the President cannot consider insurance a duplication of benefits when determining eligibility for displacement assistance provided under the Act. This assistance covers temporary housing options like hotels, motels, and staying with family/friends, ensuring individuals receive aid without insurance coverage being a disqualifying factor.",
