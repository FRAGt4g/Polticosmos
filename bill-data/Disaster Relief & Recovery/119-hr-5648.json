    "summary": "The Disaster Relief Continuity Act of 2025 aims to ensure continued funding for disaster relief efforts in the event of a lapse in appropriations. It provides funding to the FEMA Administrator for essential activities, including financial and operational support for declared disasters, salaries and expenses of essential personnel, and continued payments for existing recovery projects. The funding is available until an appropriation is enacted or until January 1, 2027. It restricts funding from being used for nonessential administrative functions, new policy development, or nondisaster related training.",
