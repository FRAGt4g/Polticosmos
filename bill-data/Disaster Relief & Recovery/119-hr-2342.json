    "summary": "The State-Managed Disaster Relief Act amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to establish alternate procedures for states and tribal governments to receive lump-sum payments for covered small disasters, in lieu of traditional Public Assistance Program funds. This allows them to receive 80% of estimated damages and use the funds as they see fit for recovery, provided they meet certain requirements concerning compliance with laws and reporting.  The bill also defines \"covered small disaster\" and specifies the programs involved.",
