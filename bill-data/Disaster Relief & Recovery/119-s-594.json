    "summary": "The bill, the Helping Eliminate Limitations for Prompt Response and Recovery Act (or HELP Response and Recovery Act), amends the Post-Katrina Management Reform Act of 2006 by repealing an obsolete section related to DHS contracting requirements. It mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit reports to relevant congressional committees on how this repeal prevents waste and promotes savings. These reports must also detail FEMA contracts awarded under urgent circumstances, including contract subject, amount, state benefited, and disaster/emergency.",
