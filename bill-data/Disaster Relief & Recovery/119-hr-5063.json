    "summary": "The 'Safe Beaches, Safe Swimmers Act' addresses lifeguard staffing at federal swimming areas and beaches. It mandates that the Secretary of the Interior address staffing shortages by entering agreements with local government agencies to provide lifeguard services. These agencies will be reimbursed for their expenses. The bill defines key terms, including 'designated swim location' and 'staffing shortage'. The aim is ensuring visitor safety by maintaining adequate lifeguard presence during seasonal operating hours.",
