It outlines the agency's mission, responsibilities (including disaster preparedness, response, and recovery), and the roles of the Director and regional offices. The bill also includes provisions for transferring functions, personnel, and assets from the Department of Homeland Security to the newly independent FEMA. It further makes conforming amendments to other laws, including Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, and requires a report on additional legislative recommendations.",
