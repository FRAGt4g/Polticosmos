Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to allow state, tribal, and local governments to receive federal funds for restoration work on essential access routes. The bill outlines eligibility criteria, conditions for reimbursement, addresses the potential for duplication of benefits, and specifies how eligible costs will be determined.",
