    "summary": "The Support Neighborhoods Offset Winter Damage Act of 2025 (SNOW Act) amends the Stafford Act to expand federal assistance for winter storms. It allows hazard mitigation funds to be used for activities like acquiring snow removal equipment. The bill directs FEMA to establish a process to waive certain snowfall and damage requirements for declaring a major disaster, especially for areas with high winds, prolonged lake-effect snow, or economic disadvantages. It also increases the federal cost share for disaster assistance from a minimum of 75% to 90% in designated rural or disadvantaged areas for various relief efforts.",
