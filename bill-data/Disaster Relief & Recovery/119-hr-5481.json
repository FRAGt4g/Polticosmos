    "summary": "The Wildfire Smoke Relief Act aims to provide assistance to individuals at risk from wildfire smoke exposure. It defines \"individuals at risk\" based on health conditions, age, and income. The bill mandates the President, through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to provide qualified entities with resources to supply smoke-inhalation prevention equipment like air filtration units, masks, and weather-stripping devices. In cases where this equipment is insufficient, transitional shelter assistance will be provided.",
