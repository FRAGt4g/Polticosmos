    "summary": "The bill, titled the Promoting Opportunities to Widen Electrical Resilience Act of 2025 (POWER Act of 2025), amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. It authorizes federal agencies to provide essential assistance for hazard mitigation to electric utilities, allowing them to carry out cost-effective hazard mitigation activities in conjunction with power restoration efforts. The bill ensures that receiving emergency power restoration assistance doesn't disqualify a facility from hazard mitigation aid.",
