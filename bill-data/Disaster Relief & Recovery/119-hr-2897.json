    "summary": "This bill amends the Small Business Act to provide disaster loans for damages caused by prolonged power outages. It defines a \"prolonged power outage\" based on the number of affected homes/businesses and the duration of the outage (either 48 hours concurrently or resulting in significant uninsured losses). The bill allows loan proceeds to be used for energy resilience systems (generators, solar panels, etc.) and to replace lost food and drink. It covers both Section 7(b)(1)(A) and (2) of the Small Business Act.",
