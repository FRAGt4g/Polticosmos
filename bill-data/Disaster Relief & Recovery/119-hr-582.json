    "summary": "The Community Protection and Wildfire Resilience Act establishes a grant program administered by FEMA to help eligible entities (states, tribes, local governments, etc.) develop and implement plans to mitigate wildfire risk. Grants can be used for community protection and wildfire resilience projects (e.g. early detection, evacuation planning, infrastructure hardening), or for developing the plans themselves. The bill outlines eligible activities, defines key terms, sets grant criteria, prioritizes high-risk areas, and authorizes appropriations. It also mandates GAO reports on wildfire protection programs and a study on community wildfire survivability certifications. Further, the bill amends existing legislation to allow structure hardening. Finally, it addresses radio communication interoperability for emergency response.",
