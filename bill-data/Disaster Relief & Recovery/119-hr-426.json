    "summary": "The Housing Survivors of Major Disasters Act is a bipartisan bill aimed at making it easier for survivors of major disasters to receive federal housing assistance. The bill expands the types of documentation FEMA can accept to prove home ownership, including self-declarations of \"constructive ownership\" for those without traditional deeds. It also amends the Stafford Act to allow aid for homes that are \"damaged,\" not only those \"rendered uninhabitable,\" and makes permanent a pilot program for repair grants, making housing solutions more flexible and cost-effective. The overall goal is to expedite aid and remove barriers for disaster victims.",
