    "summary": "The bill, titled the \"Preventing Environmental Hazards Act of 2025,\" amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. It introduces erosion coverage, allowing flood insurance to cover demolition or relocation costs for structures threatened by shoreline erosion or subject to imminent collapse or subsidence. The coverage applies to structures along lakes, bodies of water, and tidal waterbodies. Specifics include payment percentages based on demolition/relocation, structure value limitations, coverage terms, applicability, and termination of future coverage. The Administrator is tasked with creating regulations to implement the new provisions.",
