Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act for businesses and individuals affected by major disasters or emergencies in 2023 and 2024. It allows the President to waive the prohibition upon a Governor's request if it's in the public interest and won't lead to waste or fraud. The bill also sets timeframes for waiver decisions and clarifies that certain loan types are not considered duplication. Income thresholds are prohibited in waiver eligibility.",
