    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 315, directs the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to waive certain federal procurement requirements for specific U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. In the event of an emergency declared under the Robert T. Stafford Act, this legislation would exempt Puerto Rico, D.C., American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands from the application of the Buy American Act for purchases and contracts. This aims to streamline their ability to acquire necessary goods and services quickly during disaster response and recovery efforts.",
