    "summary": "The Disaster Relief Medicaid Act, if enacted, would provide Medicaid assistance to individuals and families impacted by natural disasters and emergencies. It establishes a framework for relief-eligible survivors, defining eligibility, coverage scope, and application processes (including simplified applications and presumptive eligibility). The bill also provides for 100% federal matching payments for disaster-related medical assistance and enhanced Medicaid benefits, including mental health and home-and-community-based services. Further, it directs the HHS Secretary to issue guidance and provide technical assistance to states and establishes a grant program for HCBS emergency response corps, and provides targeted Medicaid relief for direct impact areas. The bill also includes clauses that exclude the disaster relief coverage period in computing Medicare part B late enrollment period.",
