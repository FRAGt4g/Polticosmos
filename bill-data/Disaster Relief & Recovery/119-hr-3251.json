    "summary": "The Disaster Response Flexibility Act of 2025 proposes an alternative block grant program for public assistance following major disasters. The bill amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to allow states to opt for a block grant instead of direct public assistance from FEMA. It outlines procedures for application, fund usage, and reporting requirements, including initial recovery plans and annual reports. Remaining funds can be used for preparedness or mitigation. The Administrator must submit annual reports to Congress evaluating the program's effectiveness and suggesting improvements.",
