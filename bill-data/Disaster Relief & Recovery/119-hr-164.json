    "summary": "The \"Promoting Opportunities to Widen Electrical Resilience Act of 2025\" (POWER Act) is a bipartisan bill that amends the Stafford Disaster Relief Act. It allows electric utilities to use federal disaster assistance to conduct hazard mitigation activities, such as grid hardening, at the same time they are restoring power after a disaster. The bill clarifies that receiving this emergency aid for power restoration does not make a utility ineligible for other, separate hazard mitigation assistance. The goal is to proactively strengthen the electrical grid and improve its resilience against future disasters during the recovery process.",
