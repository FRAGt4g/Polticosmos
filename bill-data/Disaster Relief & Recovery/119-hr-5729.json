    "summary": "The North Rim Restoration Act of 2025 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park Service, to use emergency acquisition flexibilities to expedite contractor approval for recovery efforts in the Grand Canyon National Park impacted by the Dragon Bravo Fire. The bill outlines specific activities covered by this authority, including forest management, rebuilding, and improvements. It mandates reporting to relevant congressional committees on expenditures, cost overruns, contractor information, and potential conflicts of interest. The authority expires five years after enactment or when recovery is complete. The Secretary can request a 12-month extension if another wildfire occurs.",
