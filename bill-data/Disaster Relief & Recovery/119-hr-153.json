    "summary": "This bill, the 'Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act,' directs the Office of Management and Budget to create a public subpage on an existing government transparency website. This subpage will serve as a repository for information on federal disaster assistance. Covered federal agencies, including FEMA, the Small Business Administration, and HUD, must report quarterly on the aid they provide. Required information includes total amounts, project-specific details like location and status, and other reporting data. The goal is to increase transparency and accountability for disaster relief spending by making the data public and machine-readable.",
