    "summary": "The 'Expediting Hazard Mitigation Assistance Projects Act' allows the FEMA Administrator to waive or reduce certain environmental and historic preservation requirements for property acquisition, structure demolition, or relocation projects funded under Stafford Act and National Flood Insurance Act programs. This aims to streamline the process for hazard mitigation projects. The bill mandates consultation with state and local officials before waivers and requires annual reports to Congress on the use of these waivers. It also amends the Stafford Act related to hazard mitigation.",
