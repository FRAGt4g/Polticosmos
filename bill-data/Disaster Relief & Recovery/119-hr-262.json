    "summary": "The Disaster Reforestation Act amends the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to provide tax relief for timber owners following natural disasters. It allows them to calculate casualty losses for uncut timber based on the timber's appraised market value before the event, rather than its lower cost basis. This applies to timber held for business that is lost to fire, storms, insects, or drought. To qualify for this more favorable deduction, landowners must reforest the affected area within five years, a provision aimed at helping the timber industry recover while promoting sustainable forestry.",
