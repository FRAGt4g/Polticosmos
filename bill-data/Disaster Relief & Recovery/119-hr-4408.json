    "summary": "H.R. 4408, the \"Understanding Noncontiguous Infrastructure and Threats Year-round Act\" aims to improve disaster response and recovery in noncontiguous communities (e.g., islands, territories). It mandates studies and reports concerning workforce retention at FEMA,  a GAO review focusing on disaster recovery efforts and comparing them with practices in contiguous communities, and a FEMA pilot program for utilizing new technology in preliminary damage assessments. The bill directs briefings to relevant congressional committees on the study results and pilot program implementation and sets a sunset date for the pilot.",
