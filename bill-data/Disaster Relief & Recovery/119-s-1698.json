    "summary": "The 'Small Business Disaster Coordination Act' amends the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008. It mandates the Small Business Administration (SBA) to coordinate with resource partners on disaster planning and response activities. Key provisions include authorizing resource partners to provide assistance across geographic boundaries, extending the assistance period, ensuring service continuity, and allowing resource partner access to SBA facilities and information. The bill also amends existing sections of the Small Business Act to facilitate information sharing and coordination with resource partners to amplify public awareness among disaster loan applicants.",
