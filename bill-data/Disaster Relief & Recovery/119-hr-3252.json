    "summary": "The Disaster Housing Flexibility Act of 2025 proposes an alternative block grant program for states to fund temporary housing assistance after a major disaster. Administered by FEMA, the program allows states to opt for a block grant instead of individuals applying for assistance under section 408(c) of the Stafford Act. The bill outlines requirements for state applications, reporting on fund usage, and a report to Congress regarding program implementation and effectiveness. Remaining funds can be used for preparedness or mitigation. The definition of temporary housing assistance is clarified.",
