    "summary": "The Strategic Teams for Organized Response Mobilization Act (STORM Act) aims to streamline the use of health care workforce platforms during declared emergencies. The bill allows the President to certify and enter agreements with these platforms, facilitating the deployment of credentialed independent contractor health care workers. It enables the President to coordinate with states to waive licensure requirements for out-of-state workers during emergencies and mandates reporting on the use of these waivers. The Act also provides liability protections for workers and platforms involved in emergency response, with exceptions for misconduct.",
