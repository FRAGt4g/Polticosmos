    "summary": "This bill, the Direct Property Acquisitions Act, establishes a pilot program allowing covered communities (local governments meeting specific criteria) to directly apply for hazard mitigation assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for property acquisition, demolition, or relocation related to natural disasters. It defines key terms, outlines the selection process for participating communities (including consultation with states), sets a participation limit (48 months), and mandates an annual report to Congress evaluating the program's effectiveness and whether it should be made permanent. The program will terminate eight years after the selection of covered communities. Funding is authorized via appropriations.",
