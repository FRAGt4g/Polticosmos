    "summary": "The Wildfire Communications Resiliency Act aims to expedite the construction, rebuilding, or hardening of communications facilities following major disasters or emergencies related to wildfires. The bill exempts such projects from certain environmental and historical preservation reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), streamlining the process for restoring and enhancing communications infrastructure in affected areas. The bill defines key terms like \"covered project,\" \"major disaster,\" and \"emergency\" and specifies conditions for exemptions, including time limits and geographical scope.",
