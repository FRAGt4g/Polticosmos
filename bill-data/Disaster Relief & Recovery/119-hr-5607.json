    "summary": "The Flood Insurance Transparency Act of 2025 amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to increase public access to information related to the National Flood Insurance Program. It mandates the Administrator make publicly available data, models, assessments, and loss information (including individual property risk, policy, and claim data, the age of construction, and mitigation efforts). It also requires a searchable database for participating communities, revealing compliance status, property counts in flood zones, and loss data. Data will be provided at the ZIP code or census block level, protecting individual owner information, but enabling better understanding of flood risks and program performance.",
