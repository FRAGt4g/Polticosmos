    "summary": "This bill, titled the Replacing Essential Passports and Licenses After Certain Emergencies Act (REPLACE Act), amends the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018. It mandates the President, in consultation with state governors, to automatically waive fees for critical documents (like passports and licenses) for individuals and households affected by major disasters where federal assistance is provided. The bill also requires the Secretary of State and the Director of USCIS to publicize these waivers and report annually to Congress on waiver usage and associated costs.",
