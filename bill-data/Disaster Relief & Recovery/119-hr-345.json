    "summary": "The Fire Department Repayment Act of 2025 is a bipartisan bill aimed at ensuring local fire departments are paid promptly for assisting with fires on federal land. It directs the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Homeland Security, and Defense to establish standard operating procedures for \"reciprocal fire suppression cost share agreements\" within one year. This standardization will streamline payment timelines and require federal agencies to reimburse local departments that submit proper invoices. The bill expresses Congress's intent for these payments to occur no later than one year after the fire suppression event.",
