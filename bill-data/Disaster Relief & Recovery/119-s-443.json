    "summary": "This bill, the Fire Management Assistance Grants for Tribal Governments Act, amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to allow Indian tribal governments to directly request fire management assistance declarations and grants. It updates existing regulations to include tribal governments, outlines a procedure for requests, and ensures tribal governments can still receive assistance through state requests. The President is mandated to issue updated regulations within a year, considering unique tribal conditions and requiring government-to-government consultation.",
