    "summary": "The Noncontiguous Disaster Shipping Act aims to facilitate disaster relief in U.S. noncontiguous areas (Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Hawaii, and Alaska). It allows the head of relevant agencies to waive navigation and vessel-inspection laws for cargo transport during major disasters or emergencies declared by the President. Waivers are initially for up to 10 days, with potential extensions and a maximum aggregate duration of 45 days. The bill also mandates notification to relevant Congressional committees regarding waivers and their extensions.",
