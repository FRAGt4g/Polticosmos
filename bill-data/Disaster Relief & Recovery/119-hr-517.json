    "summary": "Introduced by Rep. Kustoff and Rep. Chu, the \"Filing Relief for Natural Disasters Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It allows the Treasury Secretary to postpone federal tax deadlines for state-declared disasters upon a governor's request, even if a federal disaster is not declared. This applies to natural catastrophes, fires, floods, or explosions. The bill also extends the mandatory postponement period for certain disaster-related tax deadlines from 60 days to 120 days, providing taxpayers more time to file and pay after being affected by a disaster.",
