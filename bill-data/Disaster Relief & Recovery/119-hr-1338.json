    "summary": "The bill, the Replacing Essential Passports and Licenses After Certain Emergencies Act (REPLACE Act), amends the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018. It mandates the President, in consultation with a state's Governor, to waive fees for critical documents (passports, licenses) for individuals and households affected by major disasters declared under the Stafford Act, provided they receive assistance and the document was destroyed. The bill also requires the Secretary of State and the Director of USCIS to publicize the waivers and submit annual reports to Congress detailing the waivers granted and associated costs.",
