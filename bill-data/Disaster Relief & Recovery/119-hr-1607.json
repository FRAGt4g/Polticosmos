    "summary": "The 'Heirs Empowerment and Inheritance Rights Act of 2025' aims to aid property owners, particularly those with \"heir property\" (inherited property with unclear title), in accessing Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds for disaster recovery (CDBG-DR) and mitigation (CDBG-MIT). The bill requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to amend regulations to accept alternative documentation of property ownership, including a standardized affidavit form and letters from various organizations. This will make it easier for individuals lacking traditional documentation to receive assistance. The affidavit form will not require notarization and is exempt from public comment periods.",
