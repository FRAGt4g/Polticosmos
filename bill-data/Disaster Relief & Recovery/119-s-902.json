    "summary": "The Wildfire Response and Preparedness Act of 2025 mandates the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to establish a standard for the response time to wildfire incidents on federal lands. It defines response time, relevant committees, and the 'Secretary concerned'.  The bill aims for a response time of no more than 30 minutes, with fire suppression assets deployed within 3 hours. It requires a joint report to Congress detailing a single point of contact, a unified budget, key performance indicators, fleet composition and needs, improvements to dispatch systems, streamlined contracting, and year-round asset availability.",
