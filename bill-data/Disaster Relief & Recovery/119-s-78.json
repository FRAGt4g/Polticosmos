    "summary": "The Taxpayer Resources Used in Emergencies Accountability Act (TRUE Accountability Act) mandates that certain federal agencies develop internal control plans for use during emergencies or crises. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required to issue guidance to these agencies within 180 days of the Act's enactment. These plans must align with Government Accountability Office (GAO) documents and include risk assessments for improper payments and fraud. Agency heads must submit plans to the Director, who will then submit them to Congress, with periodic reviews and revisions. The Act specifies no additional funding and excludes judicial review of actions under this Act.",
