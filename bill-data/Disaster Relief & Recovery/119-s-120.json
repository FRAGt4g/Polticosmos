    "summary": "The Disaster Housing Reform for American Families Act proposes a pilot program to construct temporary disaster assistance housing. It amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to establish this program, allowing the President to contract with eligible entities (manufacturers, distributors, or retailers of manufactured or modular homes) to build temporary housing units. The housing must meet specific construction standards and reflect the needs of the community. The program aims to provide housing quickly after a disaster and has guidelines for transferring the housing to affordable housing programs. The program terminates five years after the Act's enactment.",
