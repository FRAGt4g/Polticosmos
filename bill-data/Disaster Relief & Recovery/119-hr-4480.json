    "summary": "The bill, titled the Improving Disaster Assistance for Veterans Act (H.R. 4480), aims to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. It mandates the President to designate a Veteran Advocate within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This advocate will ensure fair treatment of veterans in disaster assistance, serving as a point of contact, and identifying recruitment opportunities. The bill specifically focuses on veterans' needs during disaster declarations, without expanding current authorized assistance.",
