    "summary": "The 'Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations Act' (ACERO Act) directs NASA to use its research and technology to improve aerial responses to wildfires. The bill mandates the development of advanced aircraft technologies, real-time data sharing platforms, and multi-agency coordination efforts involving federal, state, and local partners. It prohibits the procurement of unmanned aircraft systems from specific foreign entities, with a waiver for national interest. The legislation authorizes $15 million for fiscal year 2026 and requires annual progress reports to Congress until 2030, assessing the program's effectiveness.",
