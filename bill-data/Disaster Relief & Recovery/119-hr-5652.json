    "summary": "The Wildfire Recovery Act aims to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to improve wildfire management assistance. Key provisions include increasing the federal cost share for fire management assistance to at least 75%, requiring a rulemaking process for potential further increases, and updating the policy to allow reimbursement for the predeployment of domestic assets by state, local, and tribal governments. The bill's goal is to provide more flexibility and financial support for wildfire response.",
