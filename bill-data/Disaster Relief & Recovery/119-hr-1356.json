    "summary": "The Mudslide Recovery Act proposes a pilot grant program to address damage from mudslides occurring after wildland fires. The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly establish the program, providing grants on a competitive basis to eligible recipients (states, tribes, local governments, fire departments, and non-profits). It defines key terms like 'eligible recipient' and 'Secretaries concerned' and authorizes $5,000,000 in appropriations for each fiscal year from 2026 to 2032.",
