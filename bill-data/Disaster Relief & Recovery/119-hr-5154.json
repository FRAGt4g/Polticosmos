    "summary": "The Resilient Emergency Alert Communications and Training Act (REACT Act) aims to improve emergency alerting and warning systems at the state, local, and tribal levels. It mandates the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide technical and financial assistance for training, testing, and exercises of these systems. This includes developing message templates, training on best practices, and creating standardized metrics. The bill also requires an operational plan, regular reports to Congress, and has a sunset provision. It authorizes $30 million annually from 2025 to 2035 for these purposes.",
