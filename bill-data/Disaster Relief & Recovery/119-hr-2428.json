    "summary": "The Wildfire Homeowner Relief Act mandates that the Comptroller General of the United States conduct a study on a federal buyout program for homeowners in areas at high risk of catastrophic wildfires. The study will analyze the feasibility of using federal grants to purchase properties before and after disasters. It covers existing buyout programs, proposes recommendations on a new buyout program, and addresses land use after buyouts, including considerations for risk reduction, community differences, and eligibility. The Comptroller General must submit a report to Congress within 12 months, including findings, recommendations, and economic impact analyses.",
