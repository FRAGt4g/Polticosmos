Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to provide disaster relief assistance to residential common interest communities (including condominiums and housing cooperatives). It defines these terms to clarify eligibility for aid. The bill directs the President to issue rules regarding debris removal from residential common interest communities after a major disaster when deemed a threat. It also allows for federal assistance in repairing essential common elements of condominiums and housing cooperatives damaged by a major disaster.",
