    "summary": "The Wildfire Response and Preparedness Act of 2025 mandates the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to establish a standard for the response time to wildfire incidents on federal lands. It defines response time, relevant congressional committees, and Secretaries concerned, aiming for a 30-minute response time with asset deployment within 3 hours. The bill requires a joint report to Congress, outlining a single point of contact, a unified budget, key performance indicators, fleet assessments, dispatch system improvements, streamlined contracting, and year-round asset availability.",
