    "summary": "This bill amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to promote the adoption of stronger building codes for disaster resilience. It defines \"latest published editions\" as the two most recently published versions of relevant codes. It also establishes a temporary FEMA pilot program to provide grants to states and local governments, which then fund residential resilience retrofits for homeowners. The program prioritizes individuals with financial need and includes measures like home elevation, floodproofing, seismic and wildfire retrofits to reduce the impact of future natural disasters.",
