    "summary": "H.R. 459, the \"Securing Taxpayer Assistance during Natural Disasters Act\" (STAND Act), proposes to temporarily pause certain foreign aid spending after a major U.S. disaster is declared. For 60 days following a presidential disaster declaration under the Stafford Act, this bill would prohibit the Department of State and USAID from obligating or spending federal funds on bilateral, multilateral, or humanitarian non-defense foreign assistance. The prohibition can be overruled if Congress passes and enacts a joint resolution to waive it, ensuring funds are prioritized for domestic relief during a crisis.",
