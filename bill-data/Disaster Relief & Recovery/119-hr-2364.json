    "summary": "The Helene Small Business Recovery Act aims to provide a waiver of the duplication of benefits prohibition within the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The President, upon the request of a Governor, can waive this prohibition for assistance related to major disasters or emergencies in 2023 or 2024, if deemed in the public interest. The bill outlines factors the President should consider, sets a 45-day deadline for decision, clarifies that loans are not automatically considered duplication, and prohibits income thresholds for eligibility.",
