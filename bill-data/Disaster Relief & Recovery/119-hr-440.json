    "summary": "The READY Accounts Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to create new tax-advantaged savings accounts, called Residential Emergency Asset-accumulation Deferred Taxation Yield (READY) accounts. Individuals can make annual, tax-deductible contributions up to $4,500 (adjusted for inflation). The funds are intended for qualified home disaster mitigation measures, such as strengthening a home against storms, and for post-disaster recovery costs not covered by insurance. Withdrawals for these approved expenses are tax-free, but non-qualified distributions are subject to income tax and a 20% penalty. The bill aims to help homeowners proactively save for disaster preparedness and recovery.",
