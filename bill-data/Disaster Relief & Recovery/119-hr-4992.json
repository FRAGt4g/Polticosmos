    "summary": "The FEMA Critical Staffing Act mandates that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reinstate staff who were involuntarily separated between January 20, 2025, and the bill's enactment date. It requires FEMA to utilize appropriated funds for this purpose. The bill also directs the FEMA Administrator to continue existing programs supporting state and local efforts to prepare for and respond to extreme weather events, prohibiting any changes that reduce access to resources. Specifically, it mandates the immediate reinstatement of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program and the flood mitigation assistance program.",
