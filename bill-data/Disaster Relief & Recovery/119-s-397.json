    "summary": "The Small Business Disaster Damage Fairness Act of 2025 aims to amend the Small Business Act to benefit small businesses affected by disasters. Key provisions include raising the threshold for collateral requirements on disaster loans from $14,000 to $50,000 and removing the 'major disaster' limitation. The bill also mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on loan performance and requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to distinguish between rural and urban communities in its outreach and marketing for disaster assistance, following GAO recommendations.",
