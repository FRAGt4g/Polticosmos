    "summary": "The 'Fix Our Flooded Basements Act of 2025' amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to provide greater assistance for flood-damaged basements. It removes limitations on assistance for basement repairs, including addressing mold, mildew, and moisture damage. The bill also changes standards for personal property coverage and expands eligibility and coverage under the Group Flood Insurance Policy. Furthermore, it clarifies exclusions from the maximum financial assistance, such as mitigation measures and group flood insurance premiums.",
