    "summary": "This bill, the 'Federal Disaster Assistance Coordination Act,' amends the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018. It directs the FEMA Administrator, in coordination with other agencies, to study and develop a plan to streamline information collection from disaster assistance applicants to make it less burdensome. It also establishes a working group to find ways to improve preliminary damage assessments, including using new technologies like drones. The bill requires a comprehensive report of these findings to be submitted to Congress and made available to the public on FEMA's website, promoting efficiency and transparency in disaster response.",
