    "summary": "The Fire Suppression and Response Funding Assurance Act (S. 133) aims to modify the federal cost-sharing structure for fire management assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. It mandates that the federal government cover at least 75% of eligible costs. The bill also requires the President to establish criteria, via rulemaking, for increasing the federal cost share and updates policy to allow for reimbursement for pre-deployment of assets by state, local, and tribal governments.",
