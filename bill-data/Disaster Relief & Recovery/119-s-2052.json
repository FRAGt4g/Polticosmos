    "summary": "The Flood Insurance Transparency Act of 2025 amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to increase public access to information about the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). It mandates the Administrator to make publicly available data including risk assessments, policy, and claims information, particularly targeting properties covered by the NFIP and those previously covered.  Additionally, it requires the establishment of a searchable database detailing community compliance with NFIP requirements, including non-compliance findings, as well as property information based on ZIP code or census block analysis, all while ensuring protection of personally identifiable information.",
