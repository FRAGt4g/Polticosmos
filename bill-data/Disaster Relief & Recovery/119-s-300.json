    "summary": "The Disaster Loan Accountability and Reform Act (DLARA) aims to improve oversight of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) disaster loan program. It mandates more detailed monthly reports on loan statuses, including funding updates and budget changes. The bill restricts loan forgiveness without Congressional approval and sets limits on future disaster loans based on available funding. It also requires a GAO report on recent SBA rule changes and an Inspector General review of potential funding shortfalls. The bill also looks at improving budget forecasting and reporting related to disaster loans.",
