    "summary": "The Wildfire Smoke Relief Act aims to provide transitional sheltering assistance to individuals at risk of wildfire smoke-related illnesses. It defines 'individuals at risk' based on factors like income, age, and pre-existing conditions, also defines 'qualified entities'. The bill empowers the President, via FEMA, to offer financial aid to qualified entities for providing smoke-inhalation prevention equipment (air filters, masks, etc.) and, if needed, transitional shelter for those at risk.
