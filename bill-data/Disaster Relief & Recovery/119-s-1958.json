    "summary": "The Federal Operational Resilience in Emergency Conditions And Storm Tracking Act (FORECAST Act) aims to exempt certain critical positions within the National Weather Service from federal government hiring freezes. These positions, including meteorologists, hydrologists, and electronics technicians, are deemed essential for public safety, especially in issuing weather warnings and maintaining crucial equipment. The bill mandates the Secretary of Commerce to implement exemptions, report on staffing levels, and reinstate rescinded job offers. The act seeks to protect lives and property by ensuring the Weather Service can maintain adequate staffing during emergencies.",
