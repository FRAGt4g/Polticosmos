    "summary": "The Sovereign States Emergency Management Act (HR 3347) proposes to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) two years after the bill's enactment. It transfers FEMA's functions to the President and establishes a block grant program administered by the Secretary of the Treasury to provide disaster relief funding to states. Funds are allocated based on a formula considering population, historical disaster frequency, geographic risk, and economic need. States must submit emergency management plans and reports to the Secretary to receive funding. The program sunsets four years after the rule establishing the grant formula is issued.",
