    "summary": "The Stop Disaster Price Gouging Act aims to prevent businesses from excessively raising prices during and after major disasters and emergencies. It prohibits price increases exceeding 10% for essential goods and services, hotel lodging, and residential rentals for a period of 30 days, and for repair services for 180 days.  It also prevents charging prices more than 50% greater than cost. The Federal Trade Commission will enforce the act, and states and individuals can also take legal action. Violators face civil penalties.",
