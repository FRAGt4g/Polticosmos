    "summary": "This bill establishes the Natural Disaster Recovery Program and a corresponding Reserve Fund to provide federal assistance to states and Indian Tribes for unmet needs following a major disaster. It amends the Stafford Act to streamline the aid process by assessing unmet needs, giving grantees more control over spending, and expanding eligibility for home repair and rebuilding assistance. The bill also aims to improve transparency by making data public, enhancing the appeals process for individuals denied aid, and requiring FEMA to give greater weight to severe local impact when recommending disaster declarations. Several reports to Congress are mandated for oversight.",
