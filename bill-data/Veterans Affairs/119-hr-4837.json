    "summary": "The Written Informed Consent Act (H.R. 4837) directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to expand the Veterans Health Administration's informed consent directive to include several types of medications. This expansion, updating VHA Directive 1005, would require informed consent for the use of antipsychotics, stimulants, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and narcotics for veterans receiving care. The bill aims to ensure veterans are fully informed before receiving these medications.",
