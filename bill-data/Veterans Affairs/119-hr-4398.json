    "summary": "The Veteran Burial Timeliness and Death Certificate Accountability Act aims to expedite the certification of death certificates for veterans who pass away from natural causes. It mandates that VA physicians or nurse practitioners, who are the primary care providers, certify a veteran's death within 48 hours of learning about it. If they are unable, a coroner or medical examiner may do so. The bill also requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit annual reports on compliance, including reasons for non-compliance and relevant statistics.",
