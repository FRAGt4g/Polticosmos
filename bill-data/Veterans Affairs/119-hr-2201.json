    "summary": "The 'Improving VA Training for Military Sexual Trauma Claims Act' aims to improve the handling of military sexual trauma (MST) claims within the Department of Veterans Affairs. It mandates annual sensitivity training for VA employees who process, communicate about, or decide on such claims, and ensures training is experience-level appropriate. The bill also requires the VA to report on existing and planned training, expands the VA's duty to assist in obtaining relevant records, and mandates reports on sensitivity training for contracted healthcare professionals who examine veterans with MST claims, focusing on improvements to prevent re-traumatization.",
