It increases the amount of compensation for surviving spouses, tied to a percentage of the monthly compensation for veterans, and modifies requirements for compensation for survivors of veterans rated totally disabled at the time of death, considering the length of time the veteran was totally disabled. The bill also includes provisions for individuals eligible for dependents and survivors income security benefits based on veterans who died before January 1, 1993.",
