    "summary": "The 'Improving Veteran Access to Care Act' mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to create an integrated project team. This team's primary goal is to enhance the Department of Veterans Affairs' health care appointment scheduling process. It directs the development of scheduling systems for both VA personnel and patients, including self-service platforms and a telephone-based scheduling option. The bill outlines specific objectives, deadlines for establishment and completion, reporting requirements, and emphasizes coordination with the Electronic Health Record Modernization Program. It also clarifies that veterans can still schedule appointments through non-online methods. The bill aims to improve access to care, customer experience, and efficiency.",
