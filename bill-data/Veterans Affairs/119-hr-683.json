    "summary": "The Combat Veterans Pre-Enrollment Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a pilot program allowing certain active-duty Armed Forces members to pre-enroll in the VA's annual patient enrollment system before separation from service. The bill mandates a pre-enrollment mechanism, requires briefings to Congress, and mandates annual reports on participation and demographic information. The program's authority ends three years after enactment, followed by a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report evaluating its effectiveness and making recommendations.",
