    "summary": "The Veteran Burial Timeliness and Death Certificate Accountability Act aims to expedite the process of death certificate certification for deceased veterans. It mandates that VA physicians and nurse practitioners certify a veteran's death within 48 hours of learning about it.  The bill addresses delays in death certificate signing, hindering timely burials and survivor benefits. It also calls for annual reports to Congress regarding compliance with the new requirements.",
