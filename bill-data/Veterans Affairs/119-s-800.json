    "summary": "The Precision Brain Health Research Act of 2025 aims to modify the Precision Medicine for Veterans Initiative within the Department of Veterans Affairs. It expands the scope of the initiative to include research on repetitive low-level blast exposure, dementia, and other brain and mental health conditions. The bill mandates data-sharing partnerships with the Department of Defense and requires the VA to conduct research on interventions for veterans with likely low-level repetitive blast injuries. It also directs the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to assist in validating biomarkers and report on the initiative.  The bill authorizes $5 million annually from 2025-2034.",
