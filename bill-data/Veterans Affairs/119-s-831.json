It mandates that calls to veterans regarding VA services and benefits are made from a single, recognizable number and utilize caller ID branding indicating the call's origin. The bill also requires the Veterans Health Administration to operate call centers in each U.S. time zone (excluding those that don't observe daylight savings) to address appointment and referral concerns by January 1, 2026.",
