    "summary": "The Veterans Member Business Loan Act amends the Federal Credit Union Act to exclude extensions of credit made to veterans from the definition of a member business loan. This means that loans made to veterans by credit unions would be treated differently under the law, potentially impacting how these loans are regulated. The bill also defines 'veteran' according to title 38 of the United States Code and specifies that the changes take effect 180 days after enactment.",
