    "summary": "The VA Extenders Act of 2025 extends various authorities and requirements related to healthcare, benefits, housing, and other matters for veterans. It extends the authority to collect copayments, provide nursing home care, and fund programs like the Suicide Prevention Grant Program and the Rural Access Network. It also extends requirements for reports and programs related to toxic exposure presumptions, educational assistance, housing assistance, and more. Several sections amend existing laws by replacing dates (mostly September 30, 2025) with later dates (mostly September 30, 2026), thus extending these programs and requirements for another year.",
