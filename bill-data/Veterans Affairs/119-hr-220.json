    "summary": "The Veterans Infertility Treatment Act of 2025 (H.R. 220) directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide infertility treatments and fertility preservation services to eligible veterans and their partners. The bill covers services like in-vitro fertilization (IVF), allows the use of donated gametes and embryos, and extends benefits to unmarried partners, not just spouses. It establishes limits on the number of IVF cycles provided and sets a timeline for the VA to implement these new regulations. The act aims to codify and expand access to family-building care for veterans who have or are at risk of infertility.",
