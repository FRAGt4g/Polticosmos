    "summary": "The Caring for Survivors Act of 2025 aims to improve and expand eligibility for dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) paid to survivors of veterans. Key provisions include increasing the DIC amount for surviving spouses to 55% of the rate of monthly compensation for veterans with specific conditions, with a special rule for those whose benefits are predicated on a veteran's death before 1993. The bill also modifies requirements for DIC for survivors of veterans rated totally disabled at the time of death, adjusting payment amounts based on the length of the continuous disability rating.",
