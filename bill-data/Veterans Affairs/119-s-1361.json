    "summary": "The 'Every State Counts for Veterans Mental Health Act' (S.1361) aims to improve veterans' mental health support. It mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs prioritize suicide prevention grant applications from states that haven't received such grants. Within these states, eligible entities will receive scoring preference until a grant is awarded. The bill amends the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019 to achieve this.",
