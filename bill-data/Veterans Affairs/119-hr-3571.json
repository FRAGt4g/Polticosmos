    "summary": "The Veterans Administration Backlog Accountability Act of 2025 mandates the Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs to report to Congress on the backlog of disability compensation claims. The report must detail the status of the backlog, the Secretary's efforts to address it (including staffing and technology usage), the impact of staffing reductions, claimant wait times, preparation for increased claims due to the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, and recommendations for further reduction. The goal is to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the VA in processing veterans' claims.",
