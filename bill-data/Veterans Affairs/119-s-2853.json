    "summary": "The VA Extenders Act of 2025 aims to extend various Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) authorities and programs. It extends funding and requirements related to healthcare (copayments, nursing home care, suicide prevention, rural access), benefits (educational assistance, licensure clarification, regional offices), housing (homeless veterans programs, supportive services, specially adapted housing), and other matters (subpoena authority, equitable relief). Several sections specifically extend deadlines previously set for these programs, primarily pushing them from September 30, 2025, to September 30, 2026, or extending timeframes related to reports and programs. It also includes improvements to the Partial Claim Program.",
