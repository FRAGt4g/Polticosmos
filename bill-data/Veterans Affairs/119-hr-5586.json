    "summary": "The TRICARE Transition Transparency Act of 2025 mandates that the Secretary of Defense notify TRICARE beneficiaries about required changes in their TRICARE enrollment to ensure continued coverage. This includes providing notices electronically at one year, 180 days, and 30 days before a coverage transition. The bill also requires an outreach campaign, annual reports to congressional committees, and defines 'TRICARE coverage transition requirement'. The goal is to keep beneficiaries informed about changes, such as those related to age requirements.",
