    "summary": "The Veterans Full-Service Care and Access Act of 2025 aims to ensure veterans in the 48 contiguous states have access to full-service hospitals within their state under the Veterans Health Administration. If a full-service hospital isn't available, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs must provide comparable services through contracts with other healthcare providers. The bill also includes conforming and clerical amendments related to this change and mandates a report to Congress on its implementation within a year.",
