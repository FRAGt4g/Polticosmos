    "summary": "This bill mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer the Pleasant Valley Ranger District Administrative Site (approximately 232.9 acres of National Forest System land in Arizona) to Gila County, Arizona. The conveyance is free of charge, done via quitclaim deed, and subject to existing rights and other conditions deemed necessary by the Secretary to protect federal interests.  The bill stipulates the County must cover all conveyance costs and use the land solely to support veterans. If the land is used inconsistently with this purpose, it reverts to the United States.",
