    "summary": "The Health Records Enhancement Act mandates the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to allow supplementation of deceased veterans' health records. Within a year of enactment, they must establish procedures for designated individuals or immediate family members to add observed health conditions and other relevant information to the existing records. The bill defines \"immediate family member\" and \"deceased enrollee\" and clarifies that added information supplements, but does not modify, existing records.",
