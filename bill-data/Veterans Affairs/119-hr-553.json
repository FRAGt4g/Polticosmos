    "summary": "The bill, titled the \"Be Ready to Assist Veterans in Extremis Act\" or the BRAVE Act, directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a patient outreach system for veterans. This system aims to provide information on mental health care and resources to veterans enrolled in the VA system, particularly those who have experienced traumatic or stressful events. The VA is directed to coordinate this system with the Department of Defense's Transition Assistance Program, and it must be established within two years of the bill's enactment.",
