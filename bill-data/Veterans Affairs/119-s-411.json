    "summary": "The Flight 293 Remembrance Act aims to support families of Armed Forces members who died in non-combat military plane crashes. It mandates the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to identify and document these crashes (starting from 1984, with potential for earlier review). It requires the development of a public database with service member information and provides assistance to affected families, including access to benefits, personalized guidance, and support networks. A designated point of contact will facilitate family support. The bill also includes non-discrimination provisions and mandates a report to Congress on the program's progress and effectiveness.",
