    "summary": "This bill proposes to rename the Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in Northport, New York, to the Navy (SEAL) Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy VA Medical Center. It highlights the heroic actions of Lieutenant Murphy, a Navy SEAL who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his service in Afghanistan. The bill aims to honor his sacrifice and educate future generations about the value of service and the cost of freedom. The bill would change any and all future mentions of the medical center to the new name.",
