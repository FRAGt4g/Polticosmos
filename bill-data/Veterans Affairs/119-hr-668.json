    "summary": "This bill, the Coordinating Care for Senior Veterans and Wounded Warriors Act, mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a pilot program. The program aims to coordinate, navigate, and manage care and benefits for veterans enrolled in both Medicare and VA healthcare. It focuses on improving healthcare access, outcomes, quality, and cost-effectiveness while eliminating care gaps. The pilot program will assign case managers to veterans, utilize existing care models, contract with private entities where feasible, and track various metrics. The Secretary must submit regular reports on the program's progress and results, with a final recommendation on whether to extend the program.",
