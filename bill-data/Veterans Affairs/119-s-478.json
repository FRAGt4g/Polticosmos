    "summary": "The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act of 2025 aims to prevent the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from transmitting a veteran's personally identifiable information to the Department of Justice for use in the national instant criminal background check system (NICS). This restriction applies specifically when the Secretary determines benefits should be paid to a fiduciary for the veteran, unless a judge or other judicial authority deems the veteran a danger to themselves or others. The bill amends Title 38 of the United States Code.",
