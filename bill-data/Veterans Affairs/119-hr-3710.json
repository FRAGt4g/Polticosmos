    "summary": "The Loved Ones Interment Act amends Title 38 of the United States Code to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide headstones and markers for deceased veterans who were previously furnished urns. This applies when these veterans are interred at the same burial site as other eligible individuals and the headstone/marker includes information about both. The bill aims to honor veterans' final resting places when they are interred with family or other eligible individuals.",
