It limits IVF oocyte retrievals to three but allows unlimited embryo transfers based on guidelines. The bill defines infertility and fertility-related care, including specific treatments. It mandates the Secretary of Defense to establish a program to coordinate fertility-related care and provide training to community healthcare providers. The amendments will apply to services provided on or after October 1, 2027.",
