    "summary": "The VA DATA Act of 2025 aims to restrict access to and use of veterans' data. It prohibits the Department of Veterans Affairs from providing veterans' data to the US DOGE Service (Department of Government Efficiency). It also restricts special government employees from accessing or using veteran data for commercial gain or unauthorized purposes. The bill defines veteran's data, including personal health, identifying, and financial information, and outlines requirements for returning such data upon employee termination. The bill's intent is to increase data privacy and accountability surrounding veteran information.",
