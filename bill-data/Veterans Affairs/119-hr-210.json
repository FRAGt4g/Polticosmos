    "summary": "The Dental Care for Veterans Act proposes to significantly expand dental care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It amends Title 38 of the U.S. Code to require the VA to furnish dental care as a standard medical service, removing current restrictions. The bill outlines a phased-in approach over four years, progressively extending eligibility to all veterans enrolled in the VA healthcare system based on their priority group. This legislation aims to integrate comprehensive dental care into the standard medical benefits package for veterans, treating it in the same manner as any other medical care.",
