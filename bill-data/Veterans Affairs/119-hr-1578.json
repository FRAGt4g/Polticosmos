    "summary": "The Veterans Claims Education Act of 2025 aims to improve the support available to veterans filing claims with the Department of Veterans Affairs. It mandates the VA to inform claimants, especially those not represented by accredited individuals, about available assistance from veterans service organizations and accredited professionals. The bill includes provisions for an online tool to search for accredited representatives and requires warnings regarding fees charged by agents or attorneys. It also calls for a review of VA's recognition processes for these representatives and a report to Congress with recommendations.",
