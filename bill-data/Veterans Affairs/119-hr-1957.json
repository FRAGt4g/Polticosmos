    "summary": "The End Veteran Homelessness Act of 2025 aims to improve the HUD-VASH program, which provides housing assistance to homeless veterans. The bill clarifies staffing needs for case managers within the Veterans Health Administration, emphasizing services for vulnerable veterans. It mandates an annual report on HUD-VASH outcomes, including veteran demographics and case management effectiveness. Furthermore, the bill amends the HUD-VASH program to include veterans who don't require case management and outlines regulations about voucher usage. Finally, it requires a Government Accountability Office report assessing the program's impact, case manager characteristics, and housing stability metrics.",
