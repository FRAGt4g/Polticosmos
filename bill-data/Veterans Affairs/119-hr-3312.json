    "summary": "The 'Supporting Every at-Risk Veteran In Critical Emergencies Act' (SERVICE Act) aims to establish a pilot program authorizing the Attorney General to provide grants to create and operate veteran response teams within law enforcement agencies. These teams would include veteran officers, community partners, and provide training on veteran-related mental health issues. The teams' responsibilities would include 24/7 crisis response, identifying veterans in the justice system, and developing best practices. The program is set to run for five years and requires the Attorney General to report to Congress on its progress. Funding will come from grants under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.",
