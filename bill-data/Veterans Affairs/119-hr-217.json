    "summary": "H.R. 217, the \"CHIP IN for Veterans Act,\" aims to make a pilot program permanent. This program, created in 2016, allows the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to accept donated facilities and property improvements from communities. The bill removes the program's expiration date and \"pilot\" designation, formally codifying it within Title 38 of the U.S. Code. This ensures the VA can continue to leverage public-private partnerships to enhance and improve its infrastructure for veterans. The amendments are scheduled to take effect on December 16, 2026.",
