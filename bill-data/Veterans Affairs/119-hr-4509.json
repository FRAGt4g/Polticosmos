It mandates that the VA include eligible non-opioid pain management drugs and biological products, as defined in the bill, in its national formulary and drug standardization list.  The bill also places a limitation on the use of funds for these amendments. It requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to implement the amendments within 90 days of enactment.",
