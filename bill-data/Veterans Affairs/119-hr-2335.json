    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 2335, seeks to authorize the President to award the Medal of Honor posthumously to Doris Miller for his acts of valor during World War II. The bill outlines Miller's heroic actions at Pearl Harbor, including assisting his wounded captain and manning a machine gun. It highlights the historical context of racial discrimination in the Navy and the belated recognition of Miller's bravery, emphasizing that he deserves the highest military honor. The bill overrides existing time limitations to allow for the posthumous award.",
