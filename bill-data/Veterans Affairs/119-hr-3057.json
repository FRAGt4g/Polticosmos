It outlines findings highlighting the museum's purpose to honor and educate about prisoners of war and those missing in action. The bill mandates the museum director submit a report to Congress within 90 days of enactment, detailing the museum's budget, organizational structure, bylaws, and accreditation. It also provides grounds for withdrawing the designation if the museum fails to operate satisfactorily or submit the required report on time.",
