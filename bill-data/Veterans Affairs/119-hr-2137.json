    "summary": "The 'Review Every Veterans Claim Act of 2025' addresses how the Secretary of Veterans Affairs can deny veterans' claims. The bill aims to prevent claim denials solely because a veteran missed a medical examination. It amends Title 38 of the United States Code, stating that the Secretary *cannot* deny a claim on that basis, ensuring veterans receive benefits even if they miss scheduled exams. The bill's goal is to protect and support veterans in their claims.",
