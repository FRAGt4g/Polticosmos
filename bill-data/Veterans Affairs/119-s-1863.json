    "summary": "The Veteran and Active Loan Obligation Relief Act of 2025 (VALOR Act of 2025) amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify eligibility requirements for the public service loan forgiveness program. It specifically addresses borrowers who are members of the Armed Forces, National Guard, and the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The bill deems certain deferred or forborne payments as qualifying payments and waives certain requirements for those in covered active duty service, effectively making it easier for them to qualify for loan forgiveness.",
