    "summary": "The Veterans Mental Health and Addiction Therapy Quality of Care Act mandates a study comparing the quality of mental health and addiction therapy provided to veterans by Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) providers versus non-Department providers. The study, conducted by an independent organization, will assess differences across various treatment modalities (telehealth, inpatient, etc.) focusing on health outcomes, use of evidence-based practices, coordination of care, veteran-centric care, integrated care for co-occurring conditions, outcome monitoring, and time to initiate services. The findings will be reported to the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs committees and made public.",
