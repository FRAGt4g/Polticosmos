    "summary": "The Commissary Healthy Options and Servicemember Welfare (CHOW) Act proposes a pilot program to provide junior enlisted members with monthly coupons for food purchases at military commissaries. The Secretary of Defense would select two installations to conduct the program, considering factors like unaccompanied housing and commissary accessibility. The bill aims to improve access to affordable, healthy food and reduce potential food insecurity. A report on the program's effectiveness, including coupon usage, satisfaction, impact on commissary/dining facility usage, and food security rates, is required after the pilot ends.",
