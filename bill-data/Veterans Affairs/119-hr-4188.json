    "summary": "The VA Flood Preparedness Act amends title 38 of the United States Code to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide financial contributions to local authorities. These contributions would be used to mitigate the risk of flooding on local properties adjacent to VA medical facilities. Furthermore, the Secretary is required to submit a report within two years, assessing the flood risk to VA medical facilities, including those associated with rising sea levels, and whether additional resources are needed to address this risk.",
