    "summary": "The Foreign Medical Program Modernization Act of 2025 (H.R. 467) seeks to expand healthcare access for veterans living or traveling outside the United States. The bill proposes removing the current requirement that medical care received abroad must be for a service-connected disability, thereby allowing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to cover general healthcare. It also directs the VA to update its payment system to allow for electronic fund transfer reimbursements and to assess the feasibility of contracting with a third party to build a network of overseas healthcare providers.",
