    "summary": "The \"Remove the Stain Act\" aims to rescind all Medals of Honor awarded for actions during the Wounded Knee Massacre on December 29, 1890. The bill cites the massacre's brutality and the injustice of honoring those involved, highlighting findings from Congress, tribal resolutions, and historical accounts. It mandates the removal of recipients' names from the Medal of Honor Roll but does not require returning the medals or denying any federal benefits. Ultimately, the legislation seeks to address historical injustices by nullifying the recognition given for the massacre.",
