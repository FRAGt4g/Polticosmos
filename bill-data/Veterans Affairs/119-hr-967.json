    "summary": "The Modern GI Bill Act amends Title 38 of the United States Code to allow individuals eligible for Post-9/11 educational assistance to use that assistance to repay their Federal student loans. The bill sets a maximum annual payment amount, adjusted annually, and limits the number of monthly payments. It also specifies that benefits cannot be transferred and provides details on payment procedures and eligibility. The bill aims to help veterans reduce their student loan debt by utilizing their existing educational benefits.",
