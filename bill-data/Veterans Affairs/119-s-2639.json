    "summary": "The Military Spouse Entrepreneurship Act of 2025 aims to assist military spouses in starting and growing small businesses. It mandates the Small Business Administration (SBA) to create a program providing resources such as guidance on business formation, skill-building, and mentorship, including online services. The SBA can either establish a new program or extend an existing one, tailored to military spouses. The bill also requires a survey to identify challenges faced by military spouses and a report to relevant congressional committees. Finally, the bill includes outreach to ensure program awareness.",
