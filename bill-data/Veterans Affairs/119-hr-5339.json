    "summary": "The Susan E. Lukas 9/11 Servicemember Fairness Act aims to establish a presumption of service connection for veterans who developed certain diseases after being stationed at the Pentagon Reservation between September 11, 2001, and November 19, 2001. The bill specifies particular diseases (e.g., asthma, cancer) that would be considered service-related, making it easier for veterans to receive disability benefits. This aims to support veterans who may have been exposed to toxins during and after the 9/11 attacks.",
