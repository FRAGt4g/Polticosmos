    "summary": "H.R. 5593 aims to amend Title 38 of the United States Code to include eyeglass lens fittings as a covered medical service under the Veterans Community Care Program. This means veterans can receive these fittings from non-Department of Veterans Affairs providers. The bill mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish policies, procedures, and regulations to implement this change and requires a report to Congress detailing implementation status, challenges, mitigation strategies, and benefits for veterans.",
