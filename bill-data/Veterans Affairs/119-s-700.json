    "summary": "This bill, S.700, mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer the Pleasant Valley Ranger District Administrative Site (approximately 232.9 acres of National Forest System land in Arizona) to Gila County. The conveyance is free of charge but requires the county to cover associated costs (survey, environmental analysis, etc.). The land must be used to support veterans. If the land is used inconsistently, it will revert to the United States. The Secretary is exempt from providing covenants or warranties regarding environmental conditions.",
