    "summary": "The 'Veterans Foreign Medical Coverage Equality and Modernization Act of 2025' (H.R. 439) requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to furnish hospital care and medical services to veterans with permanent and total service-connected disabilities who are outside a U.S. State. This coverage is contingent on the care meeting U.S. medical standards and any prescribed medications being FDA-approved. The bill also modernizes processes by mandating direct deposit for reimbursements and upgrading VA mobile apps to allow for digital form submission, real-time tracking, and access to necessary documents. The changes take effect 90 days after enactment.",
