    "summary": "The Oath of Exit Act (HR 3640) proposes amending Title 10 of the United States Code to establish a separation oath for members of the Armed Forces. Upon retirement or separation (excluding court-martial sentences), service members can voluntarily take an oath to uphold the Constitution, support fellow veterans, maintain their well-being, and avoid harming themselves or others. This bill aims to address high veteran suicide rates by fostering a continued sense of community and commitment.",
