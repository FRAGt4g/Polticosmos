    "summary": "The 'FORGOTTEN Veterans Act of 2025' aims to expand presumptions of toxic exposure for veterans. It mandates the Secretary of Defense to broaden the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER) to include all toxic exposures and medical information. The bill presumes exposure for veterans at Department of Energy facilities and classifies the Nevada Test and Training Range as a location with contamination, requiring identification of affected veterans and treatment of relevant activities as radiation-risk activities by the Department of Veterans Affairs. It amends Title 38 of the U.S. Code related to presumptions of toxic exposure and service connection regarding lipomas and tumor related conditions.",
