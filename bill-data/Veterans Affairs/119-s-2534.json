    "summary": "The Veteran Families Health Services Act of 2025 aims to improve reproductive assistance for military personnel and veterans. It mandates fertility treatment and counseling for Armed Forces members and veterans (including spouses/partners and gestational surrogates), covers related costs (like donated genetic material procurement), and provides adoption assistance. The bill also includes provisions for fertility preservation after injury, cryopreservation of reproductive material, care continuity, and research facilitation. Regulations will be established by both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to implement these services.",
