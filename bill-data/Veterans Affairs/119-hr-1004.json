    "summary": "The \"Love Lives On Act of 2025\" amends U.S. Code to improve benefits and services for surviving spouses of veterans. It modifies eligibility for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), ensuring remarriage doesn't automatically disqualify surviving spouses. It also addresses the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for specific cases of remarriage and expands the definition of dependents under the TRICARE program to include remarried widows/widowers whose subsequent marriages have ended. The bill aims to protect and restore benefits for surviving spouses.",
