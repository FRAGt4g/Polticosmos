    "summary": "The Major Richard Star Act aims to allow veterans with combat-related disabilities to concurrently receive both veterans' disability compensation and retired pay without reduction. It amends Title 10 of the United States Code to clarify eligibility and remove existing restrictions. The bill specifies the conditions under which concurrent receipt is permitted and makes technical and conforming amendments to related sections of the law. It will take effect the first of the month following the date of enactment, applying to payments from that point forward.",
