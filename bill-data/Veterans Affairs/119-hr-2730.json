    "summary": "The Military Moms Act (H.R. 2730) aims to improve maternal healthcare access for military families. It mandates the inclusion of pregnancy and pregnancy loss as qualifying life events under the TRICARE program. The bill requires a report on maternal healthcare within the military health system, analyzing access, staffing, challenges faced, and resources. It also directs the Department of Defense to create a comprehensive online guide through the Military OneSource program, offering resources and information for pregnant beneficiaries, while prohibiting abortion-related information. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense must provide training to military and family life counselors and notify the head of the Military OneSource program of a covered beneficiary's pregnancy.",
