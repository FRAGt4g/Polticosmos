    "summary": "The Health Records Enhancement Act mandates the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to allow supplementation of deceased veterans' health records. This allows designated individuals or immediate family members to add observed health conditions and other relevant information to the records. The bill specifies the designation process and clarifies that updates supplement, not modify, existing record data. It defines \"immediate family member\" and \"deceased enrollee\" for clarity.",
