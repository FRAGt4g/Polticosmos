    "summary": "This bill, the Coordinating Care for Senior Veterans and Wounded Warriors Act, mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a pilot program. The program aims to coordinate, navigate, and manage healthcare and benefits for veterans enrolled in both Medicare and the VA system. The pilot program will focus on improving access, outcomes, quality, and cost-effectiveness of care, eliminating gaps in services, and improving care coordination. It requires case managers for participating veterans, and allows contracting with private entities. The Secretary must track key metrics and report on the program's progress and results, including a recommendation for its future.",
