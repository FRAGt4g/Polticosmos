    "summary": "The Veterans Fellowship Act (H.R. 1884) mandates the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment and Training to establish a pilot program for short-term fellowship programs for veterans. This program will utilize grants and contracts to enable states to partner with non-profit organizations and provide veterans with fellowships (up to 20 weeks), stipends, and potential long-term employment opportunities. The bill authorizes appropriations of $10 million annually from 2025 to 2029 for the pilot program and requires a report from the Comptroller General after four years.",
