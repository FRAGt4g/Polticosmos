    "summary": "The Veteran and Spouse Licensing Flexibility Act of 2025 aims to ease the process for veterans and their spouses to transfer professional licenses between states. It allows a valid license to be recognized in a new state of residence within 36 months of the veteran's discharge, provided the applicant submits required documentation and meets the new state's criteria. Temporary licenses are granted if the new state cannot process the application within 30 days. The bill defines key terms like \"covered license\" and \"licensing authority\" while also outlining background check provisions.",
