    "summary": "This bill, the Veterans Prosthetics Advancement and Reform Act, aims to improve the provision of prosthetic and rehabilitative items and services for veterans by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It mandates the VA to establish a formulary (a list) of approved items and services, solicit input from veterans, ensure availability across all VA facilities, and regularly update and publish the formulary. The bill also details the process for requesting items not on the formulary, monitoring their use, and training VA staff. Further, the bill will allow the secretary to enter into contracts for the availability of items and services in the formulary.",
