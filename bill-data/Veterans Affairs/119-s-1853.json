It amends Title 38 of the United States Code to expand direct housing loan programs to include Native Hawaiians, mirroring benefits available to Native American veterans. Furthermore, it mandates the Department of Veterans Affairs to reimburse Native Hawaiian healthcare systems for care provided to veterans and exempts Native Hawaiians from certain cost-sharing policies for healthcare.",
