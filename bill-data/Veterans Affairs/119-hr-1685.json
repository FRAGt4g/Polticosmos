    "summary": "The Justice for ALS Veterans Act of 2025 aims to extend increased dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving spouses of veterans who die from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), regardless of the duration the veteran had the disease before death. It amends Title 38 of the United States Code and specifies that surviving spouses are individuals married to the veteran for eight years or longer. The bill also mandates a report from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to Congress, identifying other service-connected disabilities that may warrant similar treatment and detailing their mortality rates and life expectancies.",
