    "summary": "The Military Learning for Credit Act of 2025 authorizes veterans to use their educational assistance to cover the costs of examinations and assessments that grant college credit. The bill defines \"veterans educational assistance\" and specifies limitations on the amount usable. It outlines how the assistance will be charged against the veteran's entitlement, differentiating between VA-administered and DoD-administered programs. Moreover, it defines 'approved program of education,' and 'covered examinations and assessments,' including DSST, CLEP, and other similar exams, and portfolio assessments.",
