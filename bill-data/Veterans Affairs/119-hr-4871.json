    "summary": "The COVID-19 Military Backpay Act of 2025 aims to provide remedies to members of the uniformed services discharged for not complying with the COVID-19 vaccination mandate. It allows covered members to file civil actions in the Court of Federal Claims seeking a determination that their discharge was involuntary or unlawful. Successful claims could result in compensation for inactive-duty training, deemed service time, eligibility for reenlistment, and other benefits, including involuntary separation pay and retirement benefits. The bill clarifies definitions related to the mandate and discharge and coordinates with Executive Order 14184.",
