    "summary": "The Veterans Community Care Scheduling Improvement Act aims to improve how veterans schedule appointments with non-Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare providers. The bill mandates the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish an online program for VA employees to schedule appointments through the Veterans Community Care Program, specifying requirements for the program, including outreach to providers and reporting to Congress. The bill also amends existing law to incorporate these changes into the United States Code and codifies the new scheduling procedures.",
