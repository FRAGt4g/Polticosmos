    "summary": "The Women Involuntarily Separated Earning Remittance Act of 2025 (WISER Act of 2025) addresses the discharge status and compensation for female veterans. It mandates programs by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense. These programs include upgrading the discharge status of eligible veterans and providing a one-time $25,000 compensation benefit. Eligibility is based on involuntary separation under Executive Order 10240, and includes rebuttable presumptions for veterans with pregnancies or childcare within a 10-month period after separation. The bill covers active-duty service between April 27, 1951, and February 23, 1976.",
