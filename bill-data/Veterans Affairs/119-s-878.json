    "summary": "This bill, the Coast Guard Combat-Injured Tax Fairness Act, amends the Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2016 to ensure that members of the Coast Guard with combat-related injuries receive the same tax benefits as other veterans. It extends the act's provisions to cover the Coast Guard when it is not operating under the Department of the Navy and addresses the restoration of improperly withheld tax amounts. The bill also sets deadlines for identifying and correcting tax withholding issues related to Coast Guard veterans' severance payments.",
