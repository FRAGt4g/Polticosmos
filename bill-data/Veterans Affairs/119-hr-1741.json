    "summary": "The Veteran Appeals Transparency Act of 2025 mandates the online publication of the Board of Veterans' Appeals docket activity. It requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to publish weekly notices on a website, detailing the cases assigned to board members for decisions. This aims to increase transparency by informing the public about the progress of veterans' appeals, excluding cases that have been advanced or remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.",
