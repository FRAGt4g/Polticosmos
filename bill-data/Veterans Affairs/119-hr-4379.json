    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 4379, amends Title 10 of the United States Code to require the Secretary of Defense to create regulations for reimbursing educational expenses. Specifically, it addresses students in the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) who are deemed medically ineligible to continue.  If a student is required to participate in ROTC while awaiting financial aid eligibility and is later found ineligible solely due to medical reasons, they will be reimbursed for certain educational costs, including tuition, fees, and room and board.  The bill outlines a process for submitting reimbursement claims.",
