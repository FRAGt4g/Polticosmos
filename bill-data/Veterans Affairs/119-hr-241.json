    "summary": "The \"Sergeant Ted Grubbs Mental Healthcare for Disabled Veterans Act\" (H.R. 241) aims to expedite mental healthcare access for specific veterans. This bill amends Title 38 of the U.S. Code to create a new access standard within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It mandates that the VA must provide hospital care, medical services, or extended care to any veteran with a service-connected mental disorder rated at 50% or higher. This care must be furnished within five days of the veteran's request, ensuring timely treatment for those with significant mental health needs.",
