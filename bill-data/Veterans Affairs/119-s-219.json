    "summary": "The Veterans Health Care Freedom Act aims to improve veterans' access to medical care by establishing a pilot program. This program allows eligible veterans to choose their healthcare providers, including those within the VA system, community facilities, and those participating in Veterans Care Agreements, without certain existing restrictions. The bill mandates the VA to provide information to veterans for informed decision-making.  The program includes primary and specialty care selection.  It also outlines reporting requirements and eventually expands the provider choice nationwide four years after enactment. The bill specifies the pilot program is to be carried out over a three-year period and emphasizes no additional appropriations.",
