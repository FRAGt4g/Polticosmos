    "summary": "H.R. 211, the 'Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act,' seeks to eliminate copayments for contraception for veterans receiving care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The bill amends Title 38 of the U.S. Code to prohibit the VA from charging for any contraceptive item that is required to be covered without cost-sharing under the Affordable Care Act. This aligns VA benefits with many private insurance plans, aiming to remove financial barriers and ensure equitable access to reproductive healthcare for veterans.",
