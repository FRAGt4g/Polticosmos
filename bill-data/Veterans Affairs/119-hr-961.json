    "summary": "The Veterans Access to Direct Primary Care Act proposes a five-year pilot program allowing eligible veterans to use veteran health savings accounts for primary care services from non-Department of Veterans Affairs providers. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will determine the annual deposit amount for these accounts. Veterans participating in the program cannot receive the covered primary care from the VA, and the bill includes measures to prevent fraud. Reports on implementation and results will be submitted to relevant committees. Funding comes from existing Veterans Health Administration appropriations.",
