    "summary": "This bill, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act (EVEST Act), aims to automatically enroll eligible veterans in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patient enrollment system. It mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enroll veterans within 60 days of receiving necessary information. The bill also requires the VA to notify veterans of their enrollment, provide opt-out instructions, and offer an electronic certificate of eligibility. Further, it calls for reports on the enrollment process and a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on the best methods for providing enrollment notices, considering veterans' individual needs based on age and location.",
