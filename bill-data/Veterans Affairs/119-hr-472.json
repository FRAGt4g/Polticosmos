    "summary": "The \"Restore Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability Act of 2025\" seeks to expedite disciplinary actions against Department of Veterans Affairs employees for misconduct or poor performance. The bill grants the VA Secretary authority to remove, demote, or suspend supervisors and other staff based on \"substantial evidence.\" It establishes an accelerated process, with decisions required within 15 business days, and replaces appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board with an internal grievance process and limited judicial review. The procedures would supersede conflicting collective bargaining agreements and apply retroactively to the enactment of a 2017 accountability law.",
