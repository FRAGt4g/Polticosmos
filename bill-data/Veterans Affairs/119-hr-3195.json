    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 3195, amends the Small Business Act to include surviving children in the definition of a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. It allows a small business, previously owned by a service-disabled veteran, to maintain its status if a surviving child acquires the veteran's ownership interest. This temporary status lasts until the child relinquishes their ownership or three years after the veteran's death.",
