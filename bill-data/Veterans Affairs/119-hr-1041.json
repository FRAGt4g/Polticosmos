    "summary": "The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act aims to prevent the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from transmitting certain beneficiary information to the Department of Justice for the national instant criminal background check system. This would only be allowed with a judicial order or finding that the beneficiary is a danger to themselves or others, particularly concerning cases where a fiduciary manages benefits. The bill seeks to amend Title 38 of the United States Code to reflect this prohibition.",
