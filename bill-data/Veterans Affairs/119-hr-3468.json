    "summary": "This bill, the Protecting Retirement and Health Benefits for Families Act, requires several federal agencies (Social Security Administration, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Housing and Urban Development) to certify to Congress that planned staffing cuts, regional office closures, or other actions will not negatively impact the provision of Congressionally-authorized services. These agencies must also submit reports detailing how they'll maintain service levels.  Inspector Generals will subsequently study the impact of these activities and report to Congress. If negative impacts are found, the agency must reverse the changes. The bill defines \"covered activity\" and \"covered agency\".",
