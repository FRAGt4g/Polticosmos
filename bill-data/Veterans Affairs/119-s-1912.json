    "summary": "The 'Protecting Veteran Community Care Act' (S. 1912) aims to expand veterans' access to mental health and substance-use services within the Department of Veterans Affairs' Community Care Program. It mandates the VA to provide community care to veterans unable to access Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs timely. The bill outlines minimum standards for community care facilities, modifies access standards, prohibits denying care due to provider limitations, and requires the VA to prioritize veterans' choice of care options. It also mandates the inclusion of additional data on community care metrics within the VA's existing reviews.",
