    "summary": "The Defense Workforce Integration Act of 2025 aims to integrate military and civilian hiring processes within the Department of Defense. It mandates the Secretary of Defense to establish a pathway for medically disqualified entry-level service members to access civilian positions. The bill also directs the provision of information on defense industry career opportunities to those ineligible for military service and requires the Secretary of the Navy to provide career information at the Military Sealift Command. A report to Congress detailing implementation is required within a year of enactment.",
