    "summary": "The Veterans\u2019 True Choice Act of 2025 amends federal law to allow veterans with service-connected disabilities to enroll in the TRICARE Select health insurance program. Veterans who choose this option cannot be simultaneously enrolled in the VA healthcare system, effectively giving them a choice between the two. The bill stipulates that the Department of Veterans Affairs will reimburse the Department of Defense for the costs of care provided to these veterans through TRICARE. It outlines a phased, multi-year implementation plan, including creating regulations and providing regular progress reports to congressional committees.",
