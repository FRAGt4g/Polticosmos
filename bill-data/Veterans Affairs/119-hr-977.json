    "summary": "The Support Military Families Act aims to allow federal employees who are spouses of armed forces members to telework or work remotely. This bill exempts them from in-person work requirements, provided they were already eligible for telework or remote work before January 20, 2025. It also mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report to assess the number of affected employees, commute distances, and the economic impact of requiring in-person work.",
