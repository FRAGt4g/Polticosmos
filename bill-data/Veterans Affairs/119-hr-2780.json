    "summary": "The \"Setting the Table for Transition Act\" (H.R. 2780) proposes a temporary expansion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) income eligibility for households that include veterans. During a 100-day period after a veteran receives their Report of Separation (DD form 214), only the veteran's income will be considered for SNAP eligibility. The definition of a veteran is an individual who served in the active military and was honorably discharged. The act would take effect 90 days after enactment.",
