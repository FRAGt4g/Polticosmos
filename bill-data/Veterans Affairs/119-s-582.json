    "summary": "The Astronaut Ground Travel Support Act enables the Administrator of NASA to authorize the use of government-owned passenger carriers to transport government astronauts and space flight participants for official purposes, including post-mission activities like medical care.  It defines passenger carriers and official purposes, allowing for the operation and maintenance of these vehicles. Transportation of international partner astronauts and non-US government space flight participants requires reimbursement to the Treasury. The bill amends existing federal code related to astronaut transportation and outlines the Administrator's regulatory authority.",
