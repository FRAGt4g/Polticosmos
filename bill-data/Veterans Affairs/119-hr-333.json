    "summary": "The Disabled Veterans Tax Termination Act amends U.S. law to permit retired military members to receive both retired pay and veterans' disability compensation concurrently. It proposes eliminating the current requirement that a veteran must have a disability rating of at least 50 percent to qualify for this benefit. The bill also extends eligibility for concurrent receipt to medical retirees with fewer than 20 years of service. These changes aim to end the dollar-for-dollar offset of retired pay, which is often described as a 'tax' on benefits for disabled veterans.",
