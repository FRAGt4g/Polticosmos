    "summary": "The Mental Health Care Provider Retention Act of 2025 aims to allow individuals transitioning from Department of Defense (DoD) mental healthcare to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) care to continue seeing their DoD mental health provider. The bill outlines provisions for continued treatment, priority levels, reimbursement, handling provider departures, medical record transfer, and defines 'covered individual.' This ensures continuity of care for veterans with mental health conditions during the transition process, facilitating a smoother transfer of care and potentially improving health outcomes.",
