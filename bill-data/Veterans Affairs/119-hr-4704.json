    "summary": "This bill, the Rotary-wing Operator Toxic Occupational Research Act (ROTOR Act), mandates a study by the Director of the Defense Health Agency on cancer prevalence and mortality among military rotary-wing pilots and aviation support personnel. The study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase determines if there's an increased prevalence/mortality of various cancers in this group versus the general population. The second phase, if needed, will identify potential carcinogenic exposures related to aircraft operation and other service-related factors. Reports are required to be submitted to relevant congressional committees.",
