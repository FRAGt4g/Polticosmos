    "summary": "The 'Industrial Certification for Coast Guard Veterans Act' mandates a report on transferring Coast Guard personnel skills to the dredging industry. The Secretary of Homeland Security must submit a report within 180 days, including an analysis of transferable skills (engineering, navigation, etc.), outreach strategies for employment in dredging, potential credentialing programs, and coordination with agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers. The bill emphasizes the importance of Federal channels and waterways for national security and economic prosperity, as maintained by the dredging industry.",
