    "summary": "The Personnel Integrity in Veterans Affairs Act of 2025 aims to increase accountability within the Department of Veterans Affairs. It mandates that a notation be made in the personnel files of VA employees who are the subject of an investigation and resign, retire, or separate from employment before the investigation concludes. It outlines the process for this notation, including notification, the right to respond, and the right to appeal. The bill also amends the law to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit annual performance plans to Congress.",
