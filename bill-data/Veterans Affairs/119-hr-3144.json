    "summary": "The Honoring our K9 Heroes Act aims to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by establishing a grant program to increase access to medical care for retired Federal working dogs. This grant program would provide financial assistance to eligible entities, such as non-profits, that support medical care for retired law enforcement and military working dogs. The bill outlines the eligibility requirements for entities seeking grants, the application process, and defines the criteria for the retired dogs covered. It authorizes appropriations of $1,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2026 to 2030.",
