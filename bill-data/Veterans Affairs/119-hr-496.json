    "summary": "The Veterans 2nd Amendment Restoration Act of 2025 aims to restore firearm rights for certain veterans. It directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to inform the Attorney General that reporting veterans to the national background check system, solely because they require a fiduciary to manage their benefits, was improper. The bill specifies that a VA determination of \"mental incompetence\" for fiduciary purposes is not sufficient on its own to prohibit a person from owning a firearm under the classification of being \"adjudicated as a mental defective,\" thus preventing them from automatically losing their Second Amendment rights.",
