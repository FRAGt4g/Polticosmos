    "summary": "The 'Veterans Member Business Loan Act' (H.R. 507) amends the Federal Credit Union Act to exclude loans made to veterans from the definition of a 'member business loan.' This reclassification is intended to ease lending restrictions for credit unions, thereby increasing veterans' access to capital for business endeavors. Sponsored by a bipartisan group of representatives, the bill defines a 'veteran' by referencing existing U.S. Code and would take effect six months after enactment. The primary goal is to support veteran entrepreneurship by reducing barriers to financing.",
