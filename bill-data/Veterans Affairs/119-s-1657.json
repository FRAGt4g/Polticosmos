    "summary": "The 'Review Every Veteran\u2019s Claim Act of 2025' aims to protect veterans' benefits claims. It restricts the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from denying a claim solely because a veteran missed a scheduled medical examination. The bill amends Title 38 of the United States Code to reflect this change, ensuring veterans' claims are assessed fairly, even if they are unable to attend a medical assessment.",
