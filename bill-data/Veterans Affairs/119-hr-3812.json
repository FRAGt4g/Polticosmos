    "summary": "This bill, the Stop Troubling Retroactive Invoices for Veteran Expenses Act of 2025 (STRIVE Act), amends Title 38 of the United States Code concerning veterans' healthcare copayments. It prohibits the Department of Veterans Affairs from collecting copayments under certain conditions, specifically if delays in processing veteran information by the VA lead to retroactive billing or if copayments exceed $2,000 due to VA errors. The bill also grants the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the authority to waive copayment requirements.",
