    "summary": "This bill, the World War II Women's Memorial Location Act, aims to allow the World War II Women's Memorial to be located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It acknowledges the vital contributions of over 18 million women who supported the U.S. military during World War II. The bill references existing legislation authorizing the memorial's establishment and proposes specific areas within the National Mall where it could be built, overcoming restrictions on memorial placement. The goal is to honor the women's service and sacrifice.",
