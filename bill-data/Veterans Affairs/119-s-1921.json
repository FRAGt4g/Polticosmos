    "summary": "The Veterans Housing Stability Act of 2025 amends Title 38 of the United States Code to modify the administration of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) housing loans. The bill establishes a Partial Claim Program allowing the VA to purchase a portion of a defaulted loan to prevent foreclosure. It also introduces civil penalties for loan holders making false statements, updates procedures for default and foreclosure, and mandates loss mitigation procedures. Additionally, it strongly encourages a foreclosure moratorium until the Partial Claim Program is fully operational. Finally it includes clerical amendments.",
