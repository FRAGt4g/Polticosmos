    "summary": "The Military Learning for Credit Act of 2025 aims to authorize veterans to use educational assistance to cover the costs of examinations and assessments that grant college credit. This includes exams like DSST and CLEP, as well as assessments of prior military training. The bill specifies the types of veterans' educational assistance that can be used, sets limitations on the amount usable, and outlines how the use of this assistance affects their overall entitlement. It also defines key terms such as 'approved program of education' and 'covered examinations and assessments'.",
