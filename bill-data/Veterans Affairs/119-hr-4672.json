    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 4672, aims to extend the consideration for firefighter retirements by modifying the definition of \"firefighter\" in U.S. Code to account for breaks in service. It allows firefighters with prior service, even if they had breaks, to have that time counted towards their retirement, provided they meet certain criteria like submitting a written election and remitting any missed contributions. It also addresses government contributions and mandates the Office of Personnel Management inform eligible individuals of their entitlement.",
