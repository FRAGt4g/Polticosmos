    "summary": "This bill, the Stratton Ridge Air Force Memorial Act, authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to relocate a memorial honoring nine Air Force crew members who died in a 1982 airplane crash. The relocation would be from private land to the Stratton Ridge rest area in North Carolina, contingent upon land owner consent and approvals from the NC Department of Transportation and potentially the Federal Highway Administration.  The bill specifies that no federal funds may be used for the relocation, installation, or maintenance, and that the requesting entity covers all associated costs. The Secretary may set terms and conditions including preventing expansion of the memorial.",
