    "summary": "The Flight 293 Remembrance Act aims to support families of Armed Forces members who died in non-combat military plane crashes. It mandates the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to identify and document these crashes, create a public database of those who died, and offer assistance to affected families. This assistance includes access to benefits, personalized guidance, and connection to support networks. The bill also requires a report to Congress on the progress and effectiveness of these efforts.",
