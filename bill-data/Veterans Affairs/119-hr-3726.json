    "summary": "The Fisher House Availability Act of 2025 aims to amend title 38 of the United States Code. It directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make temporary lodging facilities (Fisher Houses) available to certain TRICARE beneficiaries on a space-available basis. This includes beneficiaries traveling significant distances for care at non-Department facilities, and their family members providing support. The bill also establishes criteria for accessing these facilities and defines key terms like \"covered beneficiary\" and \"Fisher house.\" It seeks to expand access to temporary housing for veterans and their families.",
