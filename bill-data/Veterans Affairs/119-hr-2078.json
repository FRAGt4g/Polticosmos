    "summary": "The \"Bertie\u2019s Respect for National Cemeteries Act\" addresses the eligibility for interment and memorialization in national cemeteries. It aims to prevent those convicted of federal or state capital crimes from being buried or memorialized in these locations. The bill amends existing law to ensure appropriate officials take reasonable steps to verify eligibility. It also mandates the disinterment of George E. Siple's remains from Indiantown Gap National Cemetery and outlines notification and disposition procedures.",
