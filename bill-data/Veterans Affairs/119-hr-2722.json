    "summary": "The VA Funding and Workforce Protection Act aims to safeguard funding and personnel for the Department of Veterans Affairs. It restricts the deferral, transfer, or reprogramming of VA funding. It also exempts the VA from hiring freezes and mandates the reinstatement of certain veteran employees removed since January 20, 2025. Furthermore, it imposes limitations on layoffs and requires the Secretary to notify Congress before such actions, especially regarding probationary employees. The Secretary is required to annually certify compliance with these requirements.",
