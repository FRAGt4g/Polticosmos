    "summary": "The Veteran Fraud Reimbursement Act of 2025 aims to improve how the Secretary of Veterans Affairs repays misused benefits. It mandates the Secretary to pay beneficiaries or their successors the amount of benefits misused by a fiduciary. The bill also outlines procedures for recouping funds from the fiduciary, and reissuing payments if a beneficiary dies. It also requires the Secretary to establish methods to determine whether misuse is due to negligence by the Secretary, though reissuance of benefits can't be withheld pending that determination.",
