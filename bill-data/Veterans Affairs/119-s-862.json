    "summary": "The HBOT Access Act of 2025 aims to amend Title 38 of the United States Code to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The bill acknowledges the high suicide rate among veterans and advocates for alternative treatments, like HBOT, that don't involve drugs or invasive procedures. It emphasizes that veterans deserve accessible, effective treatments for these conditions and details the conditions covered and requirements for accessing HBOT.",
