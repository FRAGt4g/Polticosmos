    "summary": "The Lactation Spaces for Veteran Moms Act mandates that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provide lactation spaces in all its medical centers. These spaces must meet specific criteria, including being hygienic, private, accessible, and equipped with necessary amenities. The bill aims to support women veterans and the public by providing a dedicated space for expressing breast milk within VA facilities. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is given two years after the enactment of the Act to implement these changes.",
