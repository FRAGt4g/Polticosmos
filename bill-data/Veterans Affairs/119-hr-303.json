    "summary": "This bill, the Retired Pay Restoration Act, aims to eliminate the offset that reduces military retired pay for veterans who also receive disability compensation. It proposes to amend U.S. law to allow all retired members of the Armed Forces with a service-connected disability, regardless of their disability rating, to receive both their full retirement pay and their VA disability benefits concurrently. Currently, this full benefit is largely restricted to retirees with very high disability ratings or combat-related injuries. The act seeks to ensure that retired pay earned through service is not diminished due to a service-connected disability.",
