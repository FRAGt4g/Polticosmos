    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 874, proposes to amend Title 38 of the United States Code concerning Veterans Affairs. It aims to modify the payment rates for care and services provided to veterans under the Community Care Program. The key change involves establishing location-specific payment rates based on where the care or service is provided (e.g., hospital, outpatient department, physician's office). The bill also mandates the use of geographically specific provider identifiers and stipulates that the lowest rate will be paid if multiple rates apply.  The amendments are slated to take effect January 1, 2026.",
