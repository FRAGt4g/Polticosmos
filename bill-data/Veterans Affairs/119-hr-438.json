    "summary": "The \"PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support Program Act\" directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a grant program for peer-to-peer mental health support for veterans. It authorizes $25 million over three years, with grants up to $250,000 for eligible entities like veteran-focused nonprofits. Funds are for hiring veteran peer specialists and providing 24/7 non-clinical support. The bill protects veteran privacy by prohibiting the VA from requiring the collection of personally identifying information. An advisory committee will be formed to develop program standards for training and best practices.",
