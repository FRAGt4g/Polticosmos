    "summary": "The Veterans Health Care Freedom Act proposes a three-year pilot program to increase healthcare choice for veterans. Implemented in at least four Veterans Integrated Service Networks, the program would allow eligible veterans to access care at any VA medical facility, regardless of location, and at non-VA community providers without certain existing restrictions. Participants would select a primary care provider to coordinate their care. The bill also includes provisions to make these expanded choice and access rules permanent four years after its enactment, effectively granting veterans more freedom to choose their healthcare providers.",
