    "summary": "This bill, the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Coin Act, mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue commemorative coins to honor the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial and firefighters nationwide. The Act outlines coin specifications including denominations, precious metal content, and design requirements. Sales of the coins will include surcharges, with proceeds going to the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation. The bill ensures that minting and issuing the coins will not cost the U.S. government anything before funds are disbursed.",
