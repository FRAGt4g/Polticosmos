    "summary": "The CHOICE for Veterans Act of 2025 aims to reform the process for veterans seeking assistance with their benefits claims.  It addresses fee agreements between veterans and agents/attorneys, requiring transparency and limiting fees.  The bill mandates the VA to provide information on available assistance, including a publicly accessible website listing accredited individuals. It also introduces penalties for unauthorized fees and requires reviews of the recognition process for agents and attorneys, preempting inconsistent state laws, and extending certain pension payment limits.",
