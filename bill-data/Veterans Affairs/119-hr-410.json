    "summary": "H.R. 410, the \"Alaska Native Vietnam Era Veterans Land Allotment Extension Act of 2025,\" proposes to extend a land allotment program for Alaska Native veterans who served during the Vietnam War. The bill amends the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act to change the application window from a 5-year period to a 10-year period. This extension provides eligible veterans with five additional years to apply for and receive the federal land allotments to which they are entitled, directly addressing veterans' benefits and land rights for this specific Indigenous community.",
