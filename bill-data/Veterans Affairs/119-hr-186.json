    "summary": "This bill, the 'Hershel Woody Williams National Medal of Honor Monument Location Act,' authorizes the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to establish a monument on the National Mall. It specifically designates a site within 'the Reserve,' an area typically off-limits to new construction, to honor the valor and sacrifice of Medal of Honor recipients. The bill cites the Medal's historical significance, its connection to Abraham Lincoln, and the dwindling number of living recipients as justification for this prominent location, building upon a previous law that authorized the monument without specifying its site.",
