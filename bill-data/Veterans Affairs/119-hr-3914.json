    "summary": "The Valor Has No Expiration Act aims to amend Title 10 of the United States Code to allow for the review and potential awarding of military decorations that were not timely awarded due to classified or restricted records. It directs the Secretaries of the military departments to review such requests for personnel who served on active duty, particularly from January 1, 1940 onward. The bill outlines the review process, including timelines, reporting requirements to Congress and the President, and recommendations for improving award procedures, especially for military intelligence personnel.",
