    "summary": "The \"Lead by Example Act of 2025\" (H.R. 149) mandates that starting January 3, 2027, the only healthcare plan available to Members of Congress and their staff will be through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This bill would eliminate their access to the Federal Health Benefits Program and other healthcare exchanges, treating them as if they were veterans for the purpose of receiving care. The legislation also directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to jointly submit an implementation plan to Congress by September 15, 2025.",
