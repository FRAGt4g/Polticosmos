    "summary": "This bill, the \"Making It Likely for Families of the Military to Live with Leave Access Act\" (MIL FMLA Act), amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and related provisions in Title 5 of the U.S. Code to improve family and medical leave for military families. It expands the definition of \"family\" to include domestic partners and extended family members for leave purposes, and provides for up to 26 weeks of leave for eligible employees caring for a covered service member or a veteran with a serious injury or illness. The bill also amends relevant sections to reflect these expansions and clarifies notice and certification requirements.",
