    "summary": "The Veterans Readiness and Employment Transparency Act of 2025 aims to improve outreach and transparency for Department of Veterans Affairs training and rehabilitation programs. It mandates a dedicated telephone number for inquiries, requires regional offices to provide contact information online, and necessitates monthly Q&A sessions between VA employees and school certifying officials. Furthermore, it mandates in-person briefings for veterans at educational institutions and requires an annual report to Congress regarding extensions of vocational rehabilitation programs, including approval/rejection rates. The bill also specifies a 30-day timeframe for the VA to respond to extension requests.",
