    "summary": "This bill, the \"Love Lives On Act of 2025,\" aims to improve benefits and services for surviving spouses of veterans. It modifies existing laws to ensure that remarriage does not automatically disqualify surviving spouses from receiving Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) or Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) annuities. The bill also expands the definition of a dependent under the TRICARE program to include remarried widows or widowers whose subsequent marriages have ended.",
