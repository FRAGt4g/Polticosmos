    "summary": "The 'Hire Veterans Act' mandates the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to establish a pilot program for recruiting and referring veterans for employment within Federal land management agencies. This program, created in collaboration with the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs, Interior, and Agriculture, will assess veterans' strengths and abilities through specific tests, potentially waiving educational requirements. Successful candidates may receive noncompetitive appointments. The bill requires annual reports to Congress and will terminate five years after program establishment.",
