    "summary": "The Helping Heroes Act (H.R. 2077) mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish the Veteran Family Resource Program. This program aims to improve the well-being of veterans and their families by addressing social determinants of health. It will involve family coordinators in each Veterans Integrated Service Network to connect veterans with resources and support. The bill also requires surveys of disabled veterans and their families to understand their needs, and it outlines relevant goals, metrics, and reporting requirements, while also ensuring non-discrimination.",
