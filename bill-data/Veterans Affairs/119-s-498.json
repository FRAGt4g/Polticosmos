    "summary": "This bill, the United States Colored Troops Congressional Gold Medal Act, proposes to award a Congressional Gold Medal posthumously to African Americans who served with Union forces during the Civil War. The bill highlights the significant contributions and bravery of these soldiers and sailors, acknowledging their sacrifices and the historical context of their service amidst racial discrimination. It authorizes the presentation of the medal, outlines the design and striking process, mandates the Smithsonian Institution's handling of the medal for display and research, and allows for the sale of bronze duplicates. The bill frames this as a recognition of their contributions to emancipation and the preservation of the Union.",
