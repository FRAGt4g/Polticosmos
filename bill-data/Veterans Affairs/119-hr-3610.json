    "summary": "The Parity for Native Hawaiian Veterans Act of 2025 aims to improve veterans' access to benefits. It amends Title 38 of the United States Code to: (1) allow Native Hawaiian veterans to apply for direct housing loans like Native American veterans; and (2) mandate the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to reimburse Native Hawaiian health care systems for the care provided to eligible veterans. Additionally, certain Native Hawaiians will be exempt from cost-sharing for VA healthcare.",
