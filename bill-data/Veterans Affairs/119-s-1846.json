    "summary": "The 'VA Design-Build Construction Enhancement Act of 2025' aims to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs' construction projects by encouraging the use of the design-build construction method. The bill references findings about the rising costs of the VA's long-term capital plan and the successful use of design-build in other projects. It amends Title 38 of the United States Code to mandate the use of specific design-build procedures and encourage their use in conjunction with non-Department Federal entities, with the goal of more efficient, modern medical facility construction for veterans.",
