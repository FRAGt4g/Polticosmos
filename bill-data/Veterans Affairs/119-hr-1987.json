    "summary": "The Saving Our Veterans Lives Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a program providing eligible veterans and certain former service members with items like lockboxes for secure firearm storage. The bill mandates an annual report on the program's function and outreach, authorizes a public education campaign, and includes provisions for an informational video on secure storage as a suicide prevention strategy. It also specifies that participation doesn't impact firearm ownership rights and authorizes $5 million annually from 2026-2036 for the program.",
