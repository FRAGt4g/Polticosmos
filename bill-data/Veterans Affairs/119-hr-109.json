    "summary": "The \"TEAM Veteran Caregivers Act\" (H.R. 109) modifies the Department of Veterans Affairs' caregiver programs. It requires the VA to formally recognize all caregivers by noting them in the veteran's health record. The bill mandates standardized letters to notify veterans and caregivers about clinical decisions regarding program eligibility, reductions, or terminations. It also provides a temporary 90-day extension of benefits, including stipends, after a veteran is found to be no longer clinically eligible for the comprehensive family caregiver program, with certain exceptions such as fraud or abuse.",
