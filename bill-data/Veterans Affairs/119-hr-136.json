    "summary": "The Veteran Overmedication and Suicide Prevention Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to commission an independent review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The review will analyze the deaths of veterans by suicide, accident, or violence over a five-year period, focusing on the role of prescribed medications, especially for conditions like PTSD and TBI. It will assess medication practices, polypharmacy, mental health staffing, and clinical guidelines within the VA. The goal is to produce a public report for Congress with recommendations to improve veteran safety and well-being.",
