    "summary": "The Fallen Servicemembers Religious Heritage Restoration Act aims to correct historical inaccuracies in the burial markers of Jewish-American service members who were mistakenly buried under Latin crosses in overseas military cemeteries. The bill directs the American Battle Monuments Commission to establish a program to identify and contact survivors or descendants, intending to rectify this oversight during the first ten fiscal years after enactment. The program will involve contracting with a nonprofit organization, allocating $500,000 annually for this purpose. The bill emphasizes the importance of properly honoring these veterans and ensuring their heritage is recognized.",
