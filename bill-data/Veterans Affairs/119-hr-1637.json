It mandates the reinstatement of veterans who were involuntarily removed from their civil service positions between January 20, 2025, and the date the bill is enacted. The bill also requires executive branch agencies to submit reports to Congress detailing the number of veteran employees removed or dismissed, along with the reasons for those actions. The reporting requirement would end on January 20, 2029.",
