    "summary": "This bill, the Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds Congressional Gold Medal Act, aims to award a Congressional Gold Medal posthumously to Master Sergeant Roderick \"Roddie\" Edmonds for his heroic actions during World War II. Edmonds, while a prisoner of war, defied Nazi orders to segregate Jewish-American soldiers, saving the lives of approximately 200 of his fellow soldiers. The bill outlines the authorization, design, striking, and presentation of the medal, as well as provisions for duplicate medals and the medals' status. It highlights Edmonds' bravery and Yad Vashem's recognition of him as \"Righteous Among the Nations.\"",
