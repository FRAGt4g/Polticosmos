    "summary": "The Michael Lecik Military Firefighters Protection Act aims to provide presumptions of service connection for certain diseases in military veterans who served as firefighters. The bill amends Title 38 of the United States Code to establish that specific diseases, such as heart disease, lung disease, and various cancers, are considered service-connected if diagnosed within a specific timeframe after active duty, for veterans who worked as firefighters for at least five years. This allows veterans to more easily receive benefits for these illnesses.",
