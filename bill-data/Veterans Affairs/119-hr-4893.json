    "summary": "The National Guard and Reserve Student Loan Fairness Act amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide specific loan forgiveness benefits for members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces. It allows for qualifying payments to be counted towards public service loan forgiveness based on a member's years of service, as determined by points credited towards retired pay. The bill mandates data matching between the Departments of Defense and Education to identify eligible individuals and automatically count qualifying payments.",
