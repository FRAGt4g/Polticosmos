    "summary": "The Clear Communication for Veterans Claims Act mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to contract with a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) to assess the clarity and efficiency of notices sent to veterans claiming benefits. The assessment will evaluate the potential for reducing paper consumption and costs, and provide recommendations for improvement. The Secretary must then implement these recommendations and report them to relevant Congressional committees within specified timeframes. Additionally, the bill modifies a date related to housing loan fees. ",
