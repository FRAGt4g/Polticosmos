    "summary": "The 'People Over Parking Act of 2025' aims to give property owners the discretion to decide how many parking spots to provide for new residential and commercial developments. It preempts state and local laws mandating parking spot minimums, especially for projects near public transit. The bill defines key terms like 'covered public transit point' and references existing federal transportation definitions.",
