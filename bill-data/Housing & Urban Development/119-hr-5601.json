    "summary": "The Faith in Housing Act of 2025 aims to address the housing shortage in the United States by preempting state and local laws that prevent the construction of affordable housing on land owned by houses of worship (faith lands). The bill defines affordable housing and faith land, and grants houses of worship the discretion to develop affordable housing on their land, provided they notify the local zoning authority and the housing conforms to the defined requirements. The bill also includes provisions for inspections, cause of action for violations, and attorney fees. It aims to increase housing supply and address housing insecurity.",
