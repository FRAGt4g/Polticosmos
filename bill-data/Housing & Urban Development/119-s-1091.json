    "summary": "The Rural Housing Accessibility Act aims to address housing voucher portability within rural areas. It mandates that certain public housing agencies, defined as those underutilizing their budget authority, absorb 'port-in' housing choice vouchers. The bill specifies the responsibilities of these agencies, dictating how they handle voucher payments and limiting the billing period to initial public housing agencies to a maximum of 12 months. This aims to improve housing accessibility for families using vouchers in rural jurisdictions.",
