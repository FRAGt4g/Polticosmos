    "summary": "The Choice in Affordable Housing Act of 2025 aims to increase landlord participation in the Housing Choice Voucher program. The bill proposes one-time incentive payments for landlords in low-poverty areas, security deposit assistance, and landlord liaison bonus payments. It also establishes the Herschel Lashkowitz Housing Partnership Fund to further incentivize landlord participation. Additionally, the bill modifies housing quality standards and mandates the use of small area fair market rents in certain metropolitan areas. Finally, the act calls for reforming the Section 8 Management Assessment Program and annual reports on the law's effectiveness.",
