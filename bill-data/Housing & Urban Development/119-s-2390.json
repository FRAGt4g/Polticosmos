    "summary": "This bill, the \"Unlocking Housing Supply Through Streamlined and Modernized Reviews Act\", aims to expedite housing development by streamlining and modernizing environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. It directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to reclassify certain housing-related activities, such as tenant-based rental assistance and infill projects, under existing regulations (24 CFR 58.34, 58.35, and 50). The Secretary must submit annual reports detailing reductions in review times and costs, particularly in the affordable housing sector, and recommend future congressional actions.",
