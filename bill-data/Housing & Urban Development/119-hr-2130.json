    "summary": "The Tribal Trust Land Homeownership Act of 2025 aims to streamline the processing of mortgages on Indian land. It mandates that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) adhere to specific deadlines for reviewing and approving mortgage packages, including leasehold and land mortgages, and right-of-way documents. The bill also requires the BIA to provide timely notices and certified title status reports, grants relevant agencies and Tribes access to a trust asset system, and establishes a Realty Ombudsman to ensure compliance and assist with inquiries and complaints. It also mandates the Director to create an annual report and the Comptroller General to create a study.",
