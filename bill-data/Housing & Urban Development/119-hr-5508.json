    "summary": "The 'Mortgage Insurance Freedom Act' amends the National Housing Act to restrict the collection of annual mortgage insurance premiums. Specifically, the Secretary may not collect premiums when the remaining insured principal balance of a mortgage reaches 78% or less of the original sales price or appraised value of the dwelling. The bill includes exceptions if the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's capital ratio falls below 2% and mandates the Secretary to issue rules for implementation, outreach, and education for mortgagors.",
