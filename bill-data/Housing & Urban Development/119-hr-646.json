    "summary": "The Build Housing with Care Act of 2025 proposes a grant program to facilitate the co-location of affordable housing and child care facilities. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development would administer the program, awarding grants to eligible entities for design, construction, and renovation of co-location facilities. Priority is given to projects in child care deserts, low-income communities, or rural areas. The bill also mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on child care access for public housing residents, exploring the use of existing federal programs and barriers to access. The act authorizes appropriations of $100 million annually from 2025 to 2030.",
