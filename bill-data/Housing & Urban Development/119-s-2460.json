    "summary": "The 'Revitalizing Empty Structures Into Desirable Environments Act' (RESIDE Act) proposes a pilot program to convert vacant and abandoned buildings into affordable housing. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would award grants to eligible entities (participating jurisdictions) to facilitate this conversion. The grants would prioritize communities experiencing economic distress, qualified opportunity zones, projects aligned with local housing plans, and areas with reduced regulatory barriers (excluding safety and habitability ordinances). Funds can be used for various aspects of the project, including acquisition, demolition, remediation, and construction. The project is linked to the HOME Investment Partnerships Program and is slated to run between fiscal years 2027-2031, contingent on certain funding availability. A post-program report to Congress would assess its impact across several areas.",
