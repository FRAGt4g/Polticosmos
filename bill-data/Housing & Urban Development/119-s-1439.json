    "summary": "The 'Federal Home Loan Banks' Mission Activities Act' aims to enhance the Federal Home Loan Bank System's role in supporting housing, agricultural, small business, and community economic development, particularly in underserved areas like rural, urban, low-income, and Tribal communities. It broadens the scope of eligible institutions, clarifies permitted activities (including grants), and aligns executive compensation with mission achievement. Key aspects include amending the definition of 'community financial institutions,' modifying the Affordable Housing Program to include grants and adjust funding mechanisms, and requiring annual reports on collateral pledged to the Banks. It also sets guidelines for executive compensation, emphasizing mission-driven investments.",
