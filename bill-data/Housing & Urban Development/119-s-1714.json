    "summary": "The Disabled Veterans Housing Support Act aims to amend the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. It mandates that service-connected disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs be excluded when determining a person's low, moderate, or low-to-moderate income status for housing assistance programs. The bill also requires the Comptroller General to submit a report to Congress examining the treatment of such compensation across all relevant programs and providing recommendations for improvement.",
