    "summary": "The Safe Temperature Act of 2025 mandates comfortable and safe temperature levels in dwelling units receiving federal housing assistance. It amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to permit the Secretary to require owners of such units to maintain temperatures between 71 and 81 degrees Fahrenheit.  The Secretary can also use Capital or Operating Funds to maintain the temperature in public housing.  Similar rules extend to supportive housing for the elderly.",
