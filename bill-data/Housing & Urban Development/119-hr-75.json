    "summary": "This bill, the 'HOUSE Act of 2025,' directs the Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture to withdraw a final determination regarding energy efficiency standards for newly constructed, federally-financed housing. It prohibits the use of federal funds to implement or enforce this determination and requires a reversion to previous standards. The bill also blocks the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Federal Housing Finance Agency from implementing similar rules. Finally, it amends existing law to require that at least 26 states adopt a new energy code before it can be implemented on a federal level.",
