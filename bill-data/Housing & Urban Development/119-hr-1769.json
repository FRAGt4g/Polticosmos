    "summary": "The Local Zoning Decisions Protection Act of 2025 aims to nullify several Housing and Urban Development (HUD) rules and notices, specifically those related to Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing. The bill prohibits the use of federal funds for a database of geospatial information on community racial disparities and affordable housing access. It mandates the HUD Secretary to consult with state and local officials to develop recommendations for fair housing, emphasizing collaboration and transparency. The Secretary must publish a draft report, allowing for public comment, and then a final report. The bill defines key terms like 'Secretary,' 'local government official,' and 'State official.'",
