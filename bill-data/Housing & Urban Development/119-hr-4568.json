    "summary": "The SUPPLY Act aims to amend the National Housing Act to encourage the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs). It directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish a program to insure second liens on properties used to finance ADU construction. The bill outlines loan amount limits, borrower application requirements, premium structures, and reporting obligations. It also allows the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to purchase and securitize these insured loans, with exceptions based on market risks.",
