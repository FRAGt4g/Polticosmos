The bill aims to address the housing shortage by encouraging reforms to zoning regulations that currently restrict housing development.  It mandates the Assistant Secretary to produce these guidelines, consult stakeholders, and report to Congress on the adoption of the recommendations. It also abolishes the Regulatory Barriers Clearinghouse and authorizes appropriations for the act.",
