    "summary": "The 'Unlocking Housing Supply Through Streamlined and Modernized Reviews Act' aims to expedite housing development by reclassifying and streamlining environmental review processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for housing-related activities. It defines terms like 'infill project' and tasks the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with expanding and reclassifying these activities, aligning them with existing regulations for exempt and categorical exclusions. The bill also mandates an annual report on the impact of these changes on review times, costs, and affordability.",
