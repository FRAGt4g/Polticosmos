    "summary": "The Housing Supply Frameworks Act directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to publish guidelines and best practices for state and local zoning frameworks. The goal is to address the housing shortage by providing resources and recommendations to states and localities for reforming zoning regulations. This includes suggestions for reducing parking minimums, increasing building heights, streamlining review processes, and encouraging transit-oriented development.  A report to Congress is mandated to assess the impact of these guidelines. A regulatory barriers clearinghouse is abolished, and funding is authorized for these activities.",
