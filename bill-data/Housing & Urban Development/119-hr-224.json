    "summary": "The \"Disabled Veterans Housing Support Act\" (H.R. 224) amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to assist veterans applying for housing aid. The bill mandates that service-connected disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs must be excluded when calculating a person's income to determine their eligibility for housing programs aimed at low and moderate-income individuals. This change makes it easier for disabled veterans to qualify for assistance. The bill also requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on how disability pay is treated across all HUD programs and recommend legislative improvements.",
