    "summary": "The Empty Lots to Housing Act amends title 23 of the United States Code to allow the transfer of federally-assisted real property, no longer needed for its original purpose, to local governmental authorities, nonprofit organizations, or third-party entities for the development of transit-oriented dwelling units. The bill mandates that a significant portion of the housing units developed reserve affordable housing units for low-income families, ensuring that a portion are rent-controlled and affordable for very low-income families. The Secretary of Transportation must authorize the transfer, and the third party entity must comply with terms regarding affordability.",
