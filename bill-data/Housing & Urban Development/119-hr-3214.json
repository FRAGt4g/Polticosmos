    "summary": "This bill, the Housing Oversight and Mitigating Exploitation Act of 2025 (HOME Act), aims to protect consumers from price gouging in residential rental and sale prices during affordable housing crises. It empowers the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to investigate and enforce against unconscionable pricing practices, defines key terms, and outlines considerations for determining an affordable housing crisis. The bill also mandates a HUD investigation and report on housing prices, establishes a Housing Monitoring and Enforcement Unit within HUD, and addresses unfair screening practices and investments by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Furthermore, it calls for a review of anti-competitive behaviors in housing markets.",
