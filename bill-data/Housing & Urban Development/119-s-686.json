    "summary": "The Farmhouse-to-Workforce Housing Act of 2025 amends the Housing Act of 1949 to allow housing preservation grants to be used for accessory dwelling units (ADUs). It sets limitations on the use of these grants, including requirements related to single-family housing age, individual grant amounts, and the percentage of assistance allocated to grants versus loans. The bill defines ADUs, establishes requirements for ADU owners, and outlines allowable and non-allowable administrative costs. It also authorizes an appropriation of $200 million for the program.",
