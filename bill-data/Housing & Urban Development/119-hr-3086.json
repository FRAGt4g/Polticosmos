    "summary": "This bill, the \"Restoring Fair Housing Protections Eliminated by Trump Act of 2025,\" aims to restore and strengthen the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) mission to combat housing discrimination. It addresses actions taken by the previous administration that weakened fair housing protections, including halting enforcement of the Equal Access Rule and rescinding the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule. The bill mandates HUD to repeal the existing interim rule and issue a new rule defining \"affirmatively furthering fair housing.\" It also requires a report on digital platform discrimination and the establishment of a publicly available database for fair housing complaints.",
