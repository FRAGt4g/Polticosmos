    "summary": "The \"Ending Homelessness Act of 2025\" addresses homelessness through multiple avenues. It expands the Housing Choice Voucher Program, providing more vouchers and making it an entitlement program in the future. It prohibits housing discrimination based on source of income, and provides significant funding for addressing unmet needs, particularly through emergency relief grants and outreach programs. The bill also amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, permanently authorizes appropriations for grants, directs the Housing Trust Fund to prioritize homeless individuals, and offers technical assistance to align health and housing systems. It also has provisions for the eligibility of nonprofit and faith-based organizations for funding, as well as giving priority for funding to some local governments. Additionally, it addresses how security deposit can be utilized and how small area fair market rents will be established within the program.",
