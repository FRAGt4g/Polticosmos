    "summary": "The HOPE (Humans over Private Equity) for Homeownership Act aims to address the issue of hedge funds owning excess single-family residences. It proposes an excise tax on the acquisition of new single-family residences by hedge funds and imposes a tax on applicable taxpayers failing to sell excess homes. It also disallows mortgage interest and depreciation deductions for single-family residences owned by taxpayers liable for the proposed tax. The bill modifies the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.",
