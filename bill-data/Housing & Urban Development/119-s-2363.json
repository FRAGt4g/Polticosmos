    "summary": "The Build More Housing Near Transit Act of 2025 aims to incentivize the construction of affordable housing near transit. It amends Title 49, United States Code, to provide incentives within capital investment grants. This includes rating adjustments for projects demonstrating 'pro-housing policies' like eliminating parking minimums, streamlining approval processes, and increasing density. The bill also mandates the collection of data on projects utilizing these incentives, including the amount of new affordable housing expected.",
