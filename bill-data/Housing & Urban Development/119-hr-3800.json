    "summary": "This bill, the \"Keeping Homeownership Costs Down Act,\" amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. It prohibits the deferral of letters of map revision and conditional letters of map revision based on the placement of fill. The bill's prohibition is to be repealed when the FEMA administrator fully implements biological opinions from the Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA regarding such revisions. The aim is to streamline and prevent delays in the process of flood map revisions related to land modification.",
