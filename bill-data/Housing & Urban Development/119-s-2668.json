    "summary": "This bill, the Housing Oversight and Mitigating Exploitation Act of 2025 (HOME Act), aims to protect consumers from price gouging in residential rental and sale prices during affordable housing crises. It defines an 'affordable housing crisis period' and prohibits unconscionable pricing. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is granted enforcement powers, including the authority to investigate housing prices, monitor purchases of single-family housing by investors, and identify unfair screening practices. The bill also places limitations on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investments and calls for a review of anti-competitive behaviors in housing markets.",
