    "summary": "The \u201cHousing Is a Human Right Act of 2025\u201d addresses homelessness by tackling its root causes, supporting alternatives to penalization, investing in infrastructure, and ensuring voting access for those experiencing housing instability. It proposes grant programs, amendments to existing housing assistance programs (like CDBG and McKinney-Vento), studies, and revenue generation through new real estate-related taxes. It aims to increase funding for programs, particularly those aligned with Housing First and permanent supportive housing models.",
