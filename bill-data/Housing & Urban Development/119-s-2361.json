    "summary": "The Accelerating Home Building Act of 2025 aims to address the US housing shortage and cost burdens. It proposes grants to local governments to establish pre-reviewed designs for mixed-income housing, streamlining the approval process and encouraging faster construction. The bill defines key terms like 'affordable housing,' 'covered structure,' and 'eligible entity.' It outlines considerations for grant applications, including the need for affordable housing and the presence of high-opportunity areas. It also mandates reporting on the impact of these designs and authorizes appropriations for grants and technical assistance.",
