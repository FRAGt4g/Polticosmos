It establishes a program providing grants to states and eligible entities to offer downpayment assistance to first-generation homebuyers.  The bill defines key terms, specifies eligibility criteria for homebuyers and homes, outlines grant allocation and administrative procedures, and mandates reporting on program outcomes. It also includes provisions for housing counseling and a study of historical housing discrimination.",
