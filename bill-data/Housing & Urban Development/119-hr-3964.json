    "summary": "The Affordable Housing Equity Act of 2025 seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code to increase the low-income housing tax credit. The bill focuses on projects specifically designed to serve extremely low-income households. It outlines criteria for buildings to qualify for an increased tax credit, including designating a certain percentage of units for households with incomes below 30% of the area median gross income or matching the federal poverty line. This increase is intended to make projects financially feasible. The amendment is applicable to buildings receiving housing credit allocations after the Act's enactment, or for obligations after December 31, 2025.",
