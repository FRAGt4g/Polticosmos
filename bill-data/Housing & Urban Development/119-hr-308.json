    "summary": "This bill, the \"Low Income Housing for Defense Communities Act,\" aims to improve housing affordability for U.S. Armed Forces members. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude military basic housing allowance (BAH) from income calculations for low-income housing eligibility, making it easier for service members to qualify. It also incentivizes construction near large military installations by increasing the low-income housing tax credit for buildings within a 15-mile radius, effectively treating these locations as \"difficult development areas.\" The goal is to stimulate the development of more affordable rental housing in defense communities.",
