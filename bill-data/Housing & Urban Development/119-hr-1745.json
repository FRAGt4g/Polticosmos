    "summary": "This bill, the \"Humans over Private Equity for Homeownership Act,\" aims to address the issue of hedge funds owning excess single-family residences. It imposes an excise tax on hedge fund taxpayers that fail to reduce their single-family residence holdings to a permissible level. Additionally, the bill disallows mortgage interest and depreciation deductions for single-family residences owned by taxpayers liable for the new excise tax. The intent is to encourage these entities to sell these properties and enhance homeownership.",
