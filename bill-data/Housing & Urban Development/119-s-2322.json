    "summary": "The Appraisal Modernization Act aims to improve the efficiency and fairness of the housing market appraisal process. It mandates the creation of a public, searchable database containing appraisal data from various federal agencies. The bill also establishes a consumer's right to request reconsideration of value or a subsequent appraisal if they believe the initial appraisal is flawed.  It outlines creditor responsibilities for handling such requests and addresses situations involving potential discrimination. Finally, the bill directs relevant agencies to issue rules and guidance to implement these changes.",
