    "summary": "The Affordable Housing Resident Services Act authorizes funding for enriched resident services in federally assisted affordable housing. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Administration for Children and Families, will award competitive grants to eligible entities (property owners, managers, tribes). Grants can be used for activities like increasing access to health services, providing educational opportunities, promoting economic self-sufficiency, and supporting elderly and disabled residents. At least 25% of grant funds must be used for service coordinator salaries, benefits, and training. Grants are for 5 years and awarded based on specific criteria. The Director will coordinate with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.",
