    "summary": "The Mortgage Rate Reduction Act aims to facilitate mortgage assumptions and increase transparency related to government-insured loans. It allows the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to insure or guarantee second mortgages, which would help subsequent purchasers assume existing mortgages. Further, it mandates the publication of public lists detailing properties with FHA, Department of Agriculture, and VA-backed mortgages, including property addresses and origination dates.",
