    "summary": "This bill, the \"INCREASE Housing Affordability Act,\" aims to incentivize the conversion of commercial buildings into residential units through tax credits. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide credits (up to $200,000 per unit, $10M per building) for qualified conversion expenditures. It also establishes a Commercial-to-Residential Conversion Advisory Board within HUD to provide support, technical assistance, and best practices to state and local housing agencies, with authorized appropriations for these efforts.",
