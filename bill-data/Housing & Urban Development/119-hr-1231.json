    "summary": "This bill, the Supporting Transition And Recovery Through Housing Act of 2025 (START Housing Act), aims to reauthorize and expand a pilot program designed to help individuals recovering from substance use disorders secure stable housing. It amends the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, extending the program's timeframe, clarifying funding allocation, and establishing priority for states based on need (unemployment rates, labor force participation, overdose deaths, and rates of unsheltered homelessness). The bill also adds provisions for states to supplement existing funds, consult with relevant agencies, and outlines technical assistance. The overarching goal is to facilitate access to stable housing for individuals in recovery.",
