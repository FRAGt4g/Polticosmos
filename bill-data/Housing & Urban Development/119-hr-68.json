    "summary": "The Housing Fairness Act of 2025 aims to combat housing discrimination by authorizing the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to fund a nationwide testing program to detect and document discriminatory practices in renting, home purchasing, and mortgage lending. The bill significantly increases authorized funding for the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) to support private enforcement and outreach. It also creates a new competitive grant program for non-profit organizations to study the causes and effects of housing discrimination, particularly concerning veterans, and to pilot potential solutions. The act authorizes appropriations for these efforts through fiscal year 2028.",
