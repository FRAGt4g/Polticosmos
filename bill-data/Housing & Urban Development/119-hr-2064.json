    "summary": "The 'Home of Your Own Act of 2025' establishes a homeownership assistance grant program administered by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Grants will be provided to states and Indian tribes to aid eligible individuals, particularly first-time homebuyers, in purchasing eligible homes. Assistance can cover down payments, closing costs, and interest rate reductions. The bill outlines allocation formulas, eligible uses of funds, repayment requirements if the home isn't occupied, and tax implications. It mandates financial counseling for recipients and authorizes appropriations for the program's operation, including administrative costs for states, Indian tribes and training/technical assistance.",
