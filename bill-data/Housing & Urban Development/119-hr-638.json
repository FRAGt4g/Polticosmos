    "summary": "The Housing Temperature Safety Act of 2025 mandates a pilot program for installing temperature sensors in federally assisted rental housing. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will provide grants to public housing agencies and owners to install and test these sensors. The bill defines key terms, requires data collection on temperature-related complaints, and outlines interim and final evaluations of the pilot program, including reports to Congress. The evaluations will assess the effectiveness of the sensors, identify barriers, and compare various sensor technologies.  Authorization of appropriations is included for grants, administration, and technical assistance.",
