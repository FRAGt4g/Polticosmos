    "summary": "The Manufactured Housing Tenant\u2019s Bill of Rights Act of 2025 aims to protect tenants in manufactured home communities. It mandates minimum consumer protections for residents, including 1-year renewable leases, advance notice of rent increases and fees, and the right to sell their homes. It also establishes a commission to propose additional protections and offers pricing incentives for lenders who implement these safeguards. Furthermore, it details penalties for non-compliance and directs the creation of a standard site-lease agreement.",
