    "summary": "The Foreign Property Ownership Transparency Act mandates the Comptroller General of the United States to study foreign purchases of U.S. residential real estate. The study will analyze the volume, geographic concentration, ownership structures, and impact on housing affordability. It also assesses national security concerns. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will then evaluate the study's findings, consult with housing authorities, and submit recommendations to Congress within 180 days, including legislative actions for improving transparency and protecting access for U.S. residents.",
