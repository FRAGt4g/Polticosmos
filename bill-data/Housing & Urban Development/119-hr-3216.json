    "summary": "The Housing Market Transparency Act mandates the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to collect and publicly release data on properties receiving low-income housing tax credits.  This includes development costs, ownership information, habitability standards, reasons for property disposition, and expiration dates of affordable housing provisions. State agencies are required to submit data annually. The Secretary will establish data standards, provide technical assistance, minimize reporting duplication, and issue public reports and assessments on covered properties and the multifamily housing market, including data on properties no longer compliant with tax credit requirements.",
