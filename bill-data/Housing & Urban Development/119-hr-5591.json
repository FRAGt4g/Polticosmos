    "summary": "The 'Revitalizing Empty Structures Into Desirable Environments Act' (RESIDE Act) proposes a pilot program to provide grants to eligible entities to convert vacant and abandoned buildings into attainable housing. The program, funded if HOME Investment Partnerships Program funding exceeds a certain threshold, prioritizes projects in economically distressed areas, qualified opportunity zones, and those addressing local housing needs or reducing regulatory barriers. Grants can be used for various activities related to conversion, and the program is subject to HOME Investment Partnerships Program requirements. A study and report on the program's impact is mandated.",
