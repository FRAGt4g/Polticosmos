    "summary": "This bill, the Tenants' Right to Organize Act, aims to promote the formation and empowerment of tenant organizations. It amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 and the Internal Revenue Code to guarantee tenants' rights to organize, communicate with officials, and be free from retaliation. It mandates public housing agencies and owners to recognize and engage with tenant organizations, provides protections for tenant organizers, and ensures access to meeting spaces. It also addresses LIHTC projects and allocates funds for tenant outreach and capacity building and provides grants to resident councils.",
