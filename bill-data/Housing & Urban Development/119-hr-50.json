    "summary": "This bill, the \"Keeping Aid for Municipalities And Localities Accountable Act\" (KAMALA Act), amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. It prohibits federal grants under the act from being used to assist individuals who are not U.S. nationals or lawful permanent residents. It also bars the Secretary from providing these grants to any state, local government, or Indian tribe if that entity runs any housing or community development program that provides aid to such individuals. This ties federal funding to local policies on assistance for non-citizens without permanent legal status.",
