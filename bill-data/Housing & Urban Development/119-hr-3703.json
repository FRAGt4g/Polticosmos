    "summary": "The Excess Urban Heat Mitigation Act of 2025 aims to combat the urban heat island effect. It mandates the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to create a grant program for eligible entities (states, local governments, nonprofits, etc.) to fund projects mitigating urban heat. These projects include tree planting, cool roofs, cooling centers, and community outreach. The bill prioritizes projects in underserved communities and requires a matching fund (with waivers for economic hardship). It also establishes an oversight board and authorizes appropriations of $30 million annually from 2026-2033.",
