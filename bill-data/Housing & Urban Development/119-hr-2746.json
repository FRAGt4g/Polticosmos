    "summary": "The Fix Moldy Housing Act mandates the EPA to study mold assessment and remediation, develop national standards for mold levels and remediation, and establish a grant program assisting states and tribes with mold assessment and remediation efforts. The bill authorizes funding for grants to those entities to establish licensing programs for mold assessors and remediators and offers grants for assessing and remediating mold in public buildings and severely impacted homes, with a focus on low-income communities. Additionally, it defines key terms related to the bill and federal assistance.",
