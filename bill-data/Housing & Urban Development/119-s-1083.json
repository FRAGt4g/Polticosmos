    "summary": "The Land Manager Housing and Workforce Improvement Act of 2025 aims to improve housing and workforce programs for federal land management agencies. It expands the National Park Service's authority to acquire land and address housing needs, authorizes the Forest Service to address workforce housing, and facilitates partnerships to address housing shortages. The bill also supports the land manager workforce by streamlining hiring and providing non-competitive rehire eligibility for seasonal employees. It mandates reports on workforce housing needs and oversight of housing programs.",
