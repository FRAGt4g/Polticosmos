    "summary": "The Housing Unhoused Disabled Veterans Act aims to assist unhoused veterans with disabilities. It amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to exclude certain disability benefits from income calculations when determining eligibility for supported housing programs. The bill also directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to exclude these benefits when assessing veteran eligibility for housing on Department property and defines relevant terms like 'Secretary' and 'Department property.' The goal is to make it easier for veterans to access housing assistance.",
