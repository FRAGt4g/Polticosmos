    "summary": "The 'Preservation and Reinvestment Initiative for Community Enhancement Act' (PRICE Act) proposes a grant program to improve manufactured housing communities. It defines eligible communities, recipients, and projects, which include infrastructure improvements, home repairs, replacement, and resident services. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will administer the competitive grant program, prioritizing projects benefiting low-to-moderate-income residents and preserving affordability. The bill also allows for waivers of regulations and sets aside funds for Indian Tribes and tribally designated housing entities.",
