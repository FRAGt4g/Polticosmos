    "summary": "The Campus Housing Affordability for Foster Youth Act aims to amend existing legislation to provide housing assistance to students enrolled in higher education who were in foster care or are emancipated minors. The bill removes a prohibition on housing assistance for students and allows the Secretary to waive certain requirements for tenant-based assistance. This assistance will not be considered income for determining eligibility for student financial aid, calculating work income, or other related benefits.",
