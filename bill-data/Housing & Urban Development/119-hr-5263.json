    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 5263, amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. It grants the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development the primary authority to establish federal manufactured home construction and safety standards. Any other federal agency seeking to establish such standards must submit a proposal to the Secretary and obtain approval. The Secretary can reject standards that significantly increase production costs, conflict with existing standards, or for any other reason deemed appropriate. The bill clarifies that the Secretary is not obligated to create new or revised federal standards.",
