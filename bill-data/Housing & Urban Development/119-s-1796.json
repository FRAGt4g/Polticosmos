It defines residential property, investment rental property, and short-term lodging. The bill treats all residential property acquisitions by a person within a year as a single acquisition for notification purposes, amends exemptions, and mandates rule changes by the Federal Trade Commission to enforce these changes and require relevant information to assess potential antitrust violations.",
