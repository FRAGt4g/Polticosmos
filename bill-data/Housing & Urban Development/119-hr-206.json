    "summary": "The Landlord Accountability Act of 2025 amends the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination based on \"source of income,\" protecting tenants who use Section 8 vouchers, Social Security, or other forms of assistance. The bill establishes significant penalties for landlords who intentionally degrade properties to make them ineligible for federal programs or purposely leave units vacant. It enhances tenant protections by creating new complaint resolution programs, mandating public disclosure of landlord complaints, and funding tenant harassment prevention grants. Additionally, it introduces a tax credit to incentivize landlords who properly maintain housing for low-income tenants.",
