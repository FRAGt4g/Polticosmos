    "summary": "This bill, the Affordability and Fairness for Mountain Communities Act of 2025, aims to address affordable housing challenges in mountain communities. It mandates the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish a waiver program allowing local governments to calculate area median income (AMI) using ZIP codes or neighboring counties, impacting programs like public housing and Section 8.  Additionally, it requires HUD to study alternative AMI calculation methods and housing affordability metrics, and report its findings and recommendations to Congress. The study will also assess the impacts of high housing cost adjustments and seasonal workers on housing affordability.",
