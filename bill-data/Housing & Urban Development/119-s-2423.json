    "summary": "The Streamlining Rural Housing Act of 2025 aims to improve the efficiency of housing projects supported by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Agriculture. It mandates a memorandum of understanding between the Secretaries of HUD and Agriculture to streamline environmental reviews, designate a lead agency, and consider a joint inspection process. An advisory working group of stakeholders will be established. A report of recommendations for legislative, regulatory, or administrative actions for these improvements will be delivered to relevant committees. The bill includes provisions to ensure safety, costs are not shifted onto residents, and environmental standards are maintained.",
