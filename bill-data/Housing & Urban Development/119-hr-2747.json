    "summary": "The Healthy Affordable Housing Act mandates the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish a grant and loan program. This program aims to provide financial assistance to eligible entities for developing, creating, or preserving affordable housing units in neighborhoods lacking affordable housing. Grants and loans are prioritized for projects near essential amenities like health centers, pharmacies, and public transportation. The bill also requires a survey of residents to assess the benefits of living near such amenities and mandates a report to Congress. The act authorizes appropriations of $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2025 to 2029.",
