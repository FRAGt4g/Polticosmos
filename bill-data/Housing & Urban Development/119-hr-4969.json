The bill mandates a report to Congress detailing findings on potential market manipulation or price gouging, including a long-term strategy and an analysis of institutional investor impacts.  It also requires HUD to monitor purchases of manufactured homes and pad sites, investigating excessive purchases and potential abuses like price gouging, excessive rental increases, or failure to provide utilities.",
