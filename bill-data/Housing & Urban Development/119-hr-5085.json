    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 5085, aims to exempt federal actions related to the construction of infill housing from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. It defines \"infill housing\" based on site characteristics, including size, prior urban use, and environmental assessments. The bill also amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to update the National Risk Index more frequently. The core purpose is to streamline the approval process for housing projects on previously developed land.",
