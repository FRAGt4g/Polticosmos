    "summary": "The 'Build More Housing Near Transit Act of 2025' aims to incentivize the construction of affordable housing near public transit. It amends Title 49, United States Code, to provide incentives through capital investment grants. Key provisions include defining 'pro-housing policies' (reducing parking minimums, streamlining approval processes, etc.) and allowing the Secretary to adjust project ratings based on applicants' demonstrated commitment to these policies. Furthermore, the bill mandates the collection of data regarding projects utilizing these incentives, including data about the number of housing units expected as a result.",
