    "summary": "The Rural Homeownership Continuity Act of 2025 amends the Housing Act of 1949 to allow for the assumption of loans under the Doug Bereuter Section 502 Single Family Housing Loan Guarantee Program. This allows qualified individuals to take over existing guaranteed loans when purchasing a property. It also stipulates that the original borrower is relieved of liability upon transfer. The Secretary of Agriculture can issue rules allowing loan servicers to charge fees for transaction costs.",
