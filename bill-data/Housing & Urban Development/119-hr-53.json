    "summary": "The \"Responsible Borrower Protection Act of 2025\" (H.R. 53) seeks to cancel specific changes to mortgage credit fees for single-family homes managed by Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation). The bill prohibits the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) from implementing its updated pricing framework, announced in January 2023. It explicitly voids the FHFA\u2019s announcement and related lender bulletins, stating they shall have no force or effect. The legislation clarifies that it does not prohibit the general practice of risk-based pricing for mortgages, but specifically targets the 2023 changes.",
