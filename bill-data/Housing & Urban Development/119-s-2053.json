    "summary": "This bill, S.2053, aims to allow \"Write Your Own\" (WYO) insurance companies, which currently partner with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to sell flood insurance, to also offer private flood insurance products. The bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to prohibit the FEMA Administrator from restricting these companies from competing with the NFIP. This is intended to increase competition and potentially improve coverage options for consumers.",
