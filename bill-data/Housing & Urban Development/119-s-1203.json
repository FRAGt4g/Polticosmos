    "summary": "The Housing Vouchers Fairness Act, introduced in the Senate, aims to address housing affordability in high-population growth areas. It proposes authorizing $2,000,000,000 in appropriations for rental vouchers, specifically targeting public housing agencies serving areas exceeding 100,000 in population and experiencing significant growth between 2012 and 2022. The funds would be allocated based on population, existing voucher needs, and historical shortfalls.  The bill amends Section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to facilitate this program.",
