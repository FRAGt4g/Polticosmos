    "summary": "This bill, the \"Identifying Regulatory Barriers to Housing Supply Act,\" aims to address the US housing shortage and make housing more affordable. It mandates that recipients of certain Housing and Community Development Act grants submit plans to track and potentially reduce overly burdensome land use policies. These policies include zoning regulations, parking requirements, and other factors that impact housing development. The bill also includes findings on the housing shortage and the role of zoning in addressing it and calls on the Department of Housing and Urban Development to assist communities in overcoming zoning challenges to make housing more affordable.",
