    "summary": "The Excess Urban Heat Mitigation Act of 2025 aims to combat the urban heat island effect. It mandates the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish a grant program for eligible entities (states, local governments, nonprofits, etc.) to fund projects mitigating urban heat. These projects include tree planting, cool roofs, cooling centers, and community outreach. The bill prioritizes projects in underserved communities and requires a focus on environmental justice. It also includes technical assistance, matching requirements, reporting, and an oversight board. The bill authorizes $30 million annually from 2026-2033.",
