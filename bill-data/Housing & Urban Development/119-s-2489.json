    "summary": "The Modular Housing Production Act aims to facilitate the use of modular homes by reviewing and modifying Federal Housing Administration (FHA) construction financing programs. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is tasked with identifying barriers to modular home developers' participation and recommending solutions. The bill mandates a report on the review's findings and requires the initiation of a rulemaking process for an alternative draw schedule for construction financing loans. Additionally, the bill allows the Secretary to award a grant to study a standardized commercial code for modular homes to improve efficiency and coordination with financing incentives.",
