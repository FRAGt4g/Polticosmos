    "summary": "The American Dream for All Act proposes a pilot program run by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to provide down payment assistance loans to eligible homebuyers. The program will award grants to states, territories, and Indian tribes who will then administer these loans. Eligible borrowers must be citizens/permanent residents, first-time or first-generation homebuyers, complete a homebuyer education course, and have incomes below 150% of the area median income. The loans will be repaid upon sale of the home, with the repayment amount dependent on the home's appreciation. The bill authorizes appropriations for 2026-2030.",
