    "summary": "The UNLOCK Housing Act aims to facilitate the use of federal lands for affordable housing. It amends the Recreation and Public Purposes Act to define affordable housing as a public purpose. The bill also mandates the establishment of a Joint Task Force on Federal Land for Housing, composed of the Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development and the Interior, to identify suitable land, streamline transfer processes, promote affordable housing policies, and assess costs related to housing shortages. The task force is required to report annually to Congress and will be terminated after 10 years.",
