    "summary": "This bill, the Manufactured Housing Tenant's Bill of Rights Act of 2025, aims to protect residents of manufactured home communities. It requires that federally backed financing for such communities be contingent upon the community owner implementing minimum consumer protections in lease agreements. These protections include specific requirements for lease terms, rent increases, grace periods, tenant rights regarding sales, and advance notice of community sales or closures. The bill also establishes a commission to propose further consumer protection standards and mandates public availability of covered properties and penalties for violations.",
