    "summary": "The Access to Homeownership Act aims to help renters build credit by requiring multifamily borrowers with federally backed mortgage loans to report positive rental payments to consumer reporting agencies. This, with resident consent, would include 24 months of prior positive rent payments. The Director, through order or regulation, would oversee these programs for enterprises. Positive rent payments would be considered for mortgage insurance applications. Administrative costs are to be covered by the enterprises, and a report to Congress is required every five years.",
