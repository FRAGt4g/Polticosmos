    "summary": "The Deliver Housing Now Act of 2025 aims to amend the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 to address public housing. The bill seeks to remove the existing limit on the number of public housing agencies that can participate in the Moving to Work demonstration program, overseen by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The bill also changes the language to ensure that at least a certain number of agencies can join the program, replacing the original limit with a minimum threshold.",
