    "summary": "This bill, the Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act of 2025 (LIFT Homebuyers Act), establishes a program to provide low- and moderate-income first-time, first-generation homebuyers with access to affordable home loans. It creates LIFT HOME Funds within the Loan Guarantee Agencies (HUD and USDA) to be used for the program. The program involves the Treasury Department purchasing securities backed by covered mortgage loans and the Loan Guarantee Agencies setting pricing terms and establishing outreach programs. Key aspects include definitions for eligible homebuyers, covered mortgage loans, and provisions for loan guarantees and program implementation. Appropriations are authorized to support the program.",
