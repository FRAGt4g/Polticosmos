    "summary": "The Build Now Act of 2025 aims to incentivize housing growth by adjusting Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) allocations. The bill defines key terms like \"eligible recipient\" and \"housing growth improvement rate.\" It mandates the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to adjust CDBG allocations based on each recipient's housing growth improvement rate, providing bonuses for those with rates at or above the median (or are extremely high-growth recipients) and decreasing allocations for those below the median. HUD must publish an annual report on housing growth rates and provide guidance on best practices for housing supply. The adjustments will take effect beginning with the second full fiscal year after the date of enactment and remain in effect through fiscal year 2042.",
