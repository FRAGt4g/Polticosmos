    "summary": "The American Neighborhoods Protection Act of 2025 aims to limit ownership of single-family residences. It imposes an excise tax on individuals and entities owning more than 75 single-family homes, with exemptions for certain entities like mortgage holders and non-profits. The collected tax revenue will be allocated to a Housing Trust Fund, supporting down payment assistance grants for families purchasing homes. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Department of Housing and Urban Development will facilitate the grant program.",
