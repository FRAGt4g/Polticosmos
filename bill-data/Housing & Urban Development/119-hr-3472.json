    "summary": "The Housing Stability for Dreamers Act aims to amend several federal laws to ensure DACA recipients have equal access to housing benefits. The bill prohibits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Rural Housing Service, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac from denying or limiting mortgage eligibility based on a borrower's DACA status. It also clarifies that a veteran's DACA status cannot impact their housing loan benefits. The bill defines DACA recipient based on the June 15, 2012, Department of Homeland Security memo on deferred action for those who came to the US as children.",
