    "summary": "The End Tenant Credit Screening Act, introduced in the House of Representatives, aims to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It prohibits housing providers from using consumer credit checks to assess prospective and current tenants for rental housing decisions. This includes decisions about application approval, security deposits, lease terms, and tenant retention. The bill's prohibition applies even if the tenant consents, with a narrow exception for reconsideration of a denied application.",
