    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 258, aims to cancel specific changes to mortgage pricing for single-family homes. It would prohibit the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac from implementing updates to their pricing framework, which were announced in January 2023. These changes affect loan level price adjustments and credit fees. The legislation would render the associated lender letters and bulletins null and void, effectively preventing the proposed adjustments to mortgage costs from taking effect. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.",
