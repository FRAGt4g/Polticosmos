    "summary": "The Housing Vouchers Fairness Act (HR 2525) proposes to amend the United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize the appropriation of $2,000,000,000 for rental vouchers. These vouchers would be allocated to eligible public housing agencies in high-growth population areas, considering factors like population size, existing voucher shortfalls, and historical allocation issues. The bill defines eligible agencies as those serving areas with populations over 100,000 and among the 25 fastest-growing in the U.S. between 2012 and 2022.",
