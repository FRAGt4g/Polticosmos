    "summary": "The 'Getting Renewable and Energy Efficient Neighborhoods Appraisals Act of 2025' mandates that lenders provide borrowers with disclosures about energy reports related to their properties. It requires qualified appraisers to consider energy reports when valuing properties for mortgage loans. The bill defines \"covered agencies,\" \"covered loans,\" and \"energy reports,\" and sets guidelines for these reports. It also establishes an advisory committee, and requires agencies to develop guidance. The main goal is to promote the consideration of energy efficiency in home appraisals, potentially influencing loan approvals and property values.",
