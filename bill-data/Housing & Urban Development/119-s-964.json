    "summary": "This bill, the Property Improvement and Manufactured Housing Loan Modernization Act of 2025, amends the National Housing Act. It increases loan limits for property improvements and manufactured homes, allows property improvement loans to be used for constructing accessory dwelling units (ADUs), and mandates the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to develop or choose methods for annually indexing loan limits.  Additionally, it calls for a HUD study on the cost-effectiveness of factory-built housing, including modular and manufactured homes, considering factors like material waste, maintenance costs and potential uses beyond single-family housing.",
