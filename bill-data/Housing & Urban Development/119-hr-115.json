    "summary": "The \"No Free Rent for Freeloaders Act of 2025\" proposes a penalty for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for not enforcing community service and self-sufficiency requirements for public housing tenants. It directs the HUD Inspector General to annually calculate the total federal subsidies paid for non-compliant tenants and publish this amount. Subsequently, an equal amount will be rescinded from HUD's Management and Administration budget for the following fiscal year. This creates a financial incentive for HUD to ensure public housing agencies enforce existing work and community service rules.",
