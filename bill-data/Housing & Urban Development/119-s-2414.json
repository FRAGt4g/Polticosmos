    "summary": "The Housing Supply Expansion Act of 2025 aims to update the definition of a manufactured home, removing the requirement for a permanent chassis. It mandates states to certify that they treat manufactured homes without a chassis similarly to those with one, covering financing, insurance, and other areas. States must submit initial and annual certifications to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Failure to certify by the deadline can lead to a prohibition on the manufacture, installation, or sale of covered manufactured homes within the state. The bill also provides for model guidance and coordinates with other federal agencies to ensure consistent treatment of manufactured homes.",
