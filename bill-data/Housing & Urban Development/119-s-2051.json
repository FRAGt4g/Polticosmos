    "summary": "The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative Act of 2025 authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide grants to transform neighborhoods with extreme poverty into sustainable, mixed-income communities. The bill focuses on revitalizing distressed housing, investing in well-functioning services, educational opportunities, public assets, and access to jobs. Key aspects include definitions of relevant terms, eligible entities and neighborhoods, authorized activities (like housing transformation and supportive services), resident involvement, one-for-one replacement of housing, and stipulations for demolition, relocation, and fair housing practices. The bill also outlines funding authorization, reporting requirements, and the issuance of regulations.",
