    "summary": "The Sporting Firearms Access Act of 2025 seeks to reform restrictions on the importation of firearms and ammunition. It amends Title 18, Section 925(d) of the United States Code, outlining specific conditions for the Attorney General to authorize firearm and ammunition imports, particularly for sporting purposes. The bill defines \"sporting purposes,\" sets deadlines for the Attorney General's determinations, and establishes processes for denial, including providing a written basis, posting the denial online, and allowing for hearings and judicial review. It also includes technical and conforming amendments related to firearms importation and definition of terms. The bill aims to facilitate the import of firearms and ammunition designed for hunting, recreational shooting, and organized competitions.",
