    "summary": "This bill, the Guarding American Technology from Exploitation Act of 2025 (GATE Act), aims to protect U.S. national security by restricting access to National Laboratories for certain foreign nationals. It prohibits National Laboratories from admitting visitors or assignees from countries like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Cuba. Waivers are possible if the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with counterintelligence officials, determines that the benefits outweigh the risks. The Secretary of Energy is required to notify relevant congressional committees about any waivers issued.",
