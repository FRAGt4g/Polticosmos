    "summary": "The \"Justice for 9/11 Act\" (H.R. 296) addresses legal proceedings for three specific detainees at Guantanamo Bay: Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, Walid Bin \u2018Attash, and Mustafa al Hawsawi. The bill would nullify any plea agreements related to the 9/11 attacks, ensuring they can still be tried. It explicitly mandates that the death penalty be an available sentence in their trials. If sentenced, the bill requires these individuals to be held in solitary confinement at Guantanamo Bay, denied contact with foreign nationals, and prohibits their transfer to the continental U.S. or any other country.",
