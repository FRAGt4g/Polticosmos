    "summary": "This bill, the Defending Defense Research from Chinese Communist Party Espionage Act of 2025, aims to prevent foreign entities of concern, particularly those associated with the Chinese Communist Party, from accessing Department of Defense-funded research conducted by institutions of higher education. It prohibits contracts between these entities and covered institutions, requiring waivers for exceptions. Furthermore, the bill imposes post-employment restrictions on researchers involved in projects focused on critical or emerging technologies, preventing them from working for such foreign entities for a decade. The Secretary of Defense is granted waiver authority and is required to report to Congress. Additional provisions are designed to increase transparency and ensure compliance.",
