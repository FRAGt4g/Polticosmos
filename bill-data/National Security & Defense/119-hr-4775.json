    "summary": "The SBIR/STTR Foreign Interference Safeguard Act aims to prevent foreign interference in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. It extends the due diligence program to assess security risks and codifies safeguards to prevent small businesses majority-owned by venture capital, hedge funds, or private equity firms and connected to 'covered foreign entities' from receiving SBIR/STTR awards.  The bill defines 'covered foreign entities' broadly to include entities and individuals of concern, with implications for national security.",
