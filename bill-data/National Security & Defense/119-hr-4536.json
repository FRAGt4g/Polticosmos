    "summary": "The Fit for Duty Act aims to incentivize physical fitness within the Armed Forces through monetary bonuses. It mandates bonuses for service members achieving high scores on physical fitness tests, with higher amounts for perfect scores. The bill amends existing law to make these bonuses tax-exempt and requires annual reporting on the program's implementation and impact. The bill's intent is to improve military readiness and address health issues related to poor fitness.",
