    "summary": "The Defining Humanitarian Demining Assistance Act of 2025 amends Title 10 of the United States Code. It modifies the definitions of humanitarian demining assistance and stockpiled conventional munitions assistance.  Humanitarian demining assistance now explicitly includes training, equipment, and infrastructure development according to international standards for detecting and clearing landmines and explosive remnants of war.  Stockpiled conventional munitions assistance is redefined to encompass training and support for the disposal, demilitarization, and management of potentially dangerous stockpiles of explosive ordnance and small arms.",
