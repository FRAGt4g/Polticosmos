    "summary": "The 'No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act' amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to deny immigration benefits to individuals who participated in, planned, financed, supported, or facilitated the October 2023 attacks against Israel, carried out by Hamas. It also makes such individuals ineligible for immigration relief and requires the Department of Homeland Security to annually report on those seeking admission to the U.S. who fall under this category. The bill also expands the definition of those inadmissible to the US.",
