    "summary": "The bill, titled the Identifying Potential Terrorist at the Border Act of 2025, amends the Immigration and Nationality Act. It mandates that U.S. Customs and Border Protection cross-reference the names of all detained aliens with the terrorist screening database. The bill requires the Commissioner to maintain custody of an alien until this database check is completed and a result is received, thus aiming to improve national security by preventing potential terrorists from entering the country.",
