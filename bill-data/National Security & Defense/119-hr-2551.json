    "summary": "The Military Installation Retail Security Act of 2025 aims to prevent retailers controlled by \"covered nations\" (as defined in section 4872 of title 10) from operating or conducting business on U.S. military installations. It prohibits the Secretary of Defense from entering or extending long-term concessions agreements with such retailers and mandates assessments of existing agreements. Waivers are possible under specific conditions, requiring reports to Congress. The bill also establishes a process for vetting covered retailers through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and introduces termination clauses for non-compliance or misrepresentation of ownership.",
