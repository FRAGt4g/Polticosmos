    "summary": "The 'Safeguarding the Use of the National Guard Act' mandates congressional oversight of the domestic deployment of reserve components of the Armed Forces. It requires the President to submit a report to Congress within 15 days of such deployment, detailing the legal basis, goals, costs, and potential impact. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau must also brief Congress on the deployment's effectiveness. An exception is made for deployments under the Stafford Act in response to natural disasters.",
