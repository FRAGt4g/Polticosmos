    "summary": "The Foreign Adversary Communications Transparency Act mandates the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to publish a list of entities holding FCC licenses or authorizations that have foreign ownership from \"covered countries.\" The bill defines \"covered countries\" and \"covered entities.\" The FCC must initially list entities with licenses under specific acts and ownership, followed by rules for identifying and listing entities with other authorizations within 18 months.  The list will be updated annually, and the bill exempts information collection from the Paperwork Reduction Act.",
