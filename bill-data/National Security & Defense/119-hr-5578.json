    "summary": "This bill, the Expanding Whistleblower Protections for Contractors Act of 2025, aims to protect whistleblowers, including contractors and their employees, from retaliation for disclosing information about waste, fraud, and abuse related to government contracts with the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other federal agencies. It expands the definition of 'protected individual' and prohibits executive branch officials from requesting reprisals against contractors. The bill also broadens the scope of protected disclosures to include violations of law and substantial dangers to public health or safety, clarifying that whistleblower protections cannot be waived.",
