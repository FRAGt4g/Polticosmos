    "summary": "This bill, introduced in the U.S. Senate, aims to streamline the transfer of U.S. defense articles and services among the Baltic states (Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia). It removes the requirement for U.S. approval for such transfers. Furthermore, the Secretary of Defense is mandated to establish a common coalition key for sharing ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) within these countries for training and operational purposes. The bill defines \"Baltic state,\" \"defense article,\" and \"defense service.\" ",
