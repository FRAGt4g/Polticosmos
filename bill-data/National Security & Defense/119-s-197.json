    "summary": "The 'Protecting Military Installations and Ranges Act of 2025' mandates that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review real estate purchases/leases near U.S. military installations and airspace by foreign entities connected to or subsidized by Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea. The bill also restricts approval of energy projects located on such real estate pending CFIUS review and requires the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Transportation to coordinate with CFIUS. This aims to safeguard national security by mitigating potential threats from foreign ownership near sensitive military assets.",
