    "summary": "The 'States Taking Accountability for Troops Engaged in Safety Act' (STATES Act) amends Title 10 of the United States Code. It mandates that a state reimburse the federal government for the cost of deploying the National Guard if the President determines the deployment was due to state government negligence. The President can waive the reimbursement in cases of financial hardship or when the deployment primarily concerns federal property or law enforcement. The Act includes an effective date of June 1, 2025, and applies retroactively to National Guard deployments.",
