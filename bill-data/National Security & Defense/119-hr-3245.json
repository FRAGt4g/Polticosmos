    "summary": "The bill, H.R. 3245, titled the American Privacy Restoration Act, proposes the repeal of the USA PATRIOT Act. Introduced in the House of Representatives on May 7, 2025, the bill would revert the law to its pre-USA PATRIOT Act state (as of October 25, 2001). The bill was referred to multiple committees, including the Judiciary, Intelligence, Financial Services, Foreign Affairs, Energy and Commerce, Education and Workforce, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Armed Services. The primary goal is to reinstate privacy protections that were, in the view of the bill's sponsors, diminished by the PATRIOT Act.",
