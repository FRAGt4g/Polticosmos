    "summary": "The 'Advanced AI Security Readiness Act' directs the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) to develop an 'AI Security Playbook'. This playbook will identify vulnerabilities in AI technologies, strategies to defend against technology theft by threat actors, and consider the government's role in securing highly advanced AI systems. It mandates reports to congressional committees and defines key terms like 'covered AI technologies' and 'technology theft'. The NSA will engage with AI developers and researchers to inform the playbook's development.",
