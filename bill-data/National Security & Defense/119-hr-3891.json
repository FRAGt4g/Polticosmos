    "summary": "The Northern Border Security and Staffing Reform Act amends the Northern Border Security Review Act. It mandates an annual report and updated threat analysis for the northern border, focusing on staffing levels, retirement surges, housing challenges, and local recruitment plans for U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers and agents. The bill aims to address current and future staffing shortages, particularly due to anticipated retirements and the unique challenges faced by northern ports of entry.",
