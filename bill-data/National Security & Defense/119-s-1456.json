    "summary": "The Military Installation Retail Security Act of 2025 aims to restrict long-term concessions agreements between the Department of Defense and retailers controlled by \"covered nations\" on military installations. It prohibits new agreements and mandates reviews of existing contracts. The Secretary of Defense can waive these restrictions under certain conditions. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) will review retailers to assess national security implications. Various definitions are provided, including what constitutes a \"covered nation\" and \"covered retailer\". The bill establishes conditions for contract termination and ongoing reporting requirements.",
