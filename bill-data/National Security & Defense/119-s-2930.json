    "summary": "The 'Smarter Approaches to Nuclear Expenditures Act' aims to reduce spending on nuclear weapons and related defense programs. The bill proposes limitations on various aspects of the US nuclear arsenal, including: submarine purchases, intercontinental ballistic missiles, deployed warheads, bomber aircraft, and specific weapon systems (e.g., air-launched cruise missiles, low-yield warheads). It also includes a prohibition on certain programs like the Uranium Processing Facility and the B83-1 bomb, and mandates reports on implementation, cost savings, and nuclear weapon accounting. The overall goal is to modernize the existing arsenal and make responsible cuts in order to provide for the safety and security of the United States. ",
