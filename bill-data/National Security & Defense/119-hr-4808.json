    "summary": "The Parity in Diplomatic Security Investigations Act aims to streamline the process for Diplomatic Security special agents to obtain authorization for intercepting electronic communications. It calls for the Secretary of State to delegate pre-approval authority to either the Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security or the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security. The bill argues that the current system hinders timely approvals and seeks to align these agents with other federal law enforcement agencies regarding investigative recordings.",
