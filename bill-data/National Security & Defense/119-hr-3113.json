    "summary": "The Uniform School Mapping Act (H.R. 3113) aims to regulate the use of federal funds for procuring emergency response maps for schools and other sites. It prohibits the use of federal funds for emergency response maps unless specific criteria are met, ensuring digital accessibility, security, integration with public safety software, and detailed site information. The Secretary of Homeland Security is mandated to develop a strategy (with congressional committee briefings) to procure and distribute compliant maps for federally owned or leased critical sites to covered public safety agencies, promoting preparedness and information sharing.",
