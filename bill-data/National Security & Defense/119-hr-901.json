    "summary": "The bill, titled the Research Security and Accountability in DHS Act, mandates the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to create a department-wide policy to protect research and development from unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information. It amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include this requirement. Further, it calls for a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on DHS's compliance with National Security Presidential Memorandum\u201333 and relevant research security guidelines. Finally, it requires a briefing for Congressional committees on the development of these policies and processes.",
