    "summary": "The Investing in Children Before Missiles Act of 2025 proposes to pause the development of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program due to significant cost overruns and delays. It calls to extend the life of the existing Minuteman III missiles and redirect funds initially allocated for Sentinel and the W87-1 warhead to the Department of Education, supporting part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The bill also mandates an independent study on extending the Minuteman III's lifespan, analyzing costs, technologies, and strategic implications.",
