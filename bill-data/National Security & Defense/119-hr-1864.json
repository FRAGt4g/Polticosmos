    "summary": "The \"Risky Research Review Act\" establishes the Life Sciences Research Security Board. This independent agency within the Executive Branch will review proposed federal funding for high-risk life sciences research, specifically focusing on \"dual use research of concern\" and \"gain of function research\" involving pathogens. The Board will determine whether research poses threats to public health, safety, or national security, with the power to approve, deny, or temporarily suspend funding. The bill outlines the Board's composition, responsibilities, and oversight, including the need for security clearances and conflict-of-interest reviews. It also defines high-risk life sciences research, provides guidelines for agency procedures, and mandates reporting to Congress, aiming to balance scientific advancement with security concerns.",
