    "summary": "This bill, the Drug Cartel Terrorist Designation Act, mandates the Secretary of State to submit a report to Congress regarding the designation of specific Mexican drug cartels (Gulf Cartel, Cartel Del Noreste, Cartel de Sinaloa, and Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion) as foreign terrorist organizations. The report must detail the cartels' activities and justifications for the designation, or reasons for not designating them. The Secretary of State is then required to formally designate any cartels meeting the criteria. The bill also specifies the committees that should receive the report and clarifies that the designation does not affect asylum eligibility.",
