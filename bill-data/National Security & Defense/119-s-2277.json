    "summary": "The GPS Resiliency Report Act mandates the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress within one year of enactment. This report will assess risks to the Global Positioning System (GPS) and associated navigation services, particularly in conflict scenarios involving the U.S. or its allies. It requires an evaluation of competitor capabilities, current Department of Defense efforts for redundancy (including R-GPS program), and a framework for developing a terrestrial-based GPS redundancy system. The report should be unclassified but may include a classified annex. The bill defines \"appropriate committees of Congress\" and \"United States ally\".",
