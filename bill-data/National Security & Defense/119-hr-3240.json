    "summary": "This bill, the Reaffirming Every Servicemembers' Trust Of Religious Exemptions Act (RESTORE Act), mandates the Secretary of Defense to establish a Special Review Board to audit religious accommodation requests (specifically for the COVID-19 vaccine) and review service members' records. The board will assess career impacts, adjudicate career restorations (backdated promotions, pay, and benefits), expunge adverse actions, and establish a review process. Reports to Congress are required, along with an Inspector General audit. The bill aims to ensure fairness for service members who filed religious accommodation requests and experienced negative career consequences.",
