    "summary": "The SERVE Act aims to boost military recruitment by improving access to prospective applicants. It enhances recruiter access to high schools and student information, clarifies the role of the Selective Service System, establishes new JROTC affiliation types, creates a pilot program to recognize military-friendly schools (HERO schools), and provides priority consideration for military service academy applicants from high schools with above-average military enlistment rates. The bill also designates the first week of April as National Week of Military Recruitment and mandates several reports on the program's outcomes and implementation.",
