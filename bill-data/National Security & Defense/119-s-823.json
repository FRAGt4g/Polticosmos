    "summary": "The Intergovernmental Critical Minerals Task Force Act aims to reduce the United States' reliance on China and other countries for critical minerals and rare earth metals. It establishes a task force, composed of representatives from various federal agencies, to assess national security risks, make recommendations to the President, and secure US supply chains. The task force will also facilitate cooperation between federal, state, local, and tribal governments. The bill mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on the regulatory landscape for domestic critical mineral supply chains, and requires briefings and reports to Congress.",
