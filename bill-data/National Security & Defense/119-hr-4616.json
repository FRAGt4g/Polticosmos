    "summary": "The Trusted Foreign Auditing Act of 2025 amends the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to address the inspection of registered public accounting firms. It defines \"compromised auditor\" and \"covered country,\" focusing on firms potentially influenced by countries posing national security threats. The bill includes trading prohibitions for covered issuers using compromised auditors and modifies public hearing rules related to these audits, potentially making them less public under certain conditions. This aims to increase scrutiny within the financial sector regarding foreign influence.",
