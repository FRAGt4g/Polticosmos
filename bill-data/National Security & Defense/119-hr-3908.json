    "summary": "This bill, the National Emergencies Reform Act of 2025 (H.R. 3908), aims to reform the National Emergencies Act. It increases congressional oversight of presidential declarations of national emergencies by requiring joint resolutions for approval or termination, setting time limits, and restricting the President's ability to declare subsequent emergencies based on similar circumstances. It mandates reporting to Congress, disclosure of emergency action documents, and limits the invocation of emergency powers in certain scenarios. It also repeals the Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism designation for budgetary purposes.",
