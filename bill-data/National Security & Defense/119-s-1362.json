    "summary": "This bill, the Securing America\u2019s Federal Equipment Supply Chains Act (SAFE Supply Chains Act), mandates that the Department of Defense procure and use information and communications technology (ICT) products only from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or authorized resellers. It defines key terms like 'covered product' and 'authorized reseller'. The Secretary of Defense can waive this requirement under specific conditions, such as for scientific research or to avoid jeopardizing mission-critical functions, after notifying congressional defense committees. The bill also requires the Department to provide assistance to potential authorized resellers and submit annual reports to Congress detailing waiver usage and efforts to achieve full compliance. It prohibits new funding and has an effective date of one year after enactment.",
