    "summary": "The 'Investing in Children Before Missiles Act of 2025' proposes to redirect funds from the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program and the W87-1 warhead modification program to the Department of Education. The bill calls for a pause and reevaluation of the Sentinel program, extends the life of the Minuteman III missiles, and mandates an independent study by the National Academy of Sciences on extending the life of the Minuteman III. The bill highlights concerns about the cost overruns and delays of the Sentinel program and advocates for prioritizing educational investments.",
