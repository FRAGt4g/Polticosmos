    "summary": "The 'Buying Faster than the Enemy Act of 2025' aims to streamline the Department of Defense's procurement processes. It modifies existing laws to facilitate faster acquisition of commercial products and services, including sole-source contracts. Key changes involve adjusting commercial solutions openings, limiting contract clause flowdown to subcontractors, and clarifying the application of defense-unique statutes to commercial contracts. The bill also expands advance payment options and establishes broader criteria for defining commercial versus non-commercial products and services.",
