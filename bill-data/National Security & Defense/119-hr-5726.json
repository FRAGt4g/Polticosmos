    "summary": "The DOD Entrepreneurial Innovation Act aims to foster innovation within the Department of Defense. It mandates that each military department's Secretary identifies promising research programs from the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs to be included in future budgets and plans. The bill establishes advisory panels to recommend eligible programs for designation as 'Entrepreneurial Innovation Projects,' providing benefits such as inclusion in the future-years defense program and separate programming proposals. It also outlines criteria for designation and the process for revoking it.",
