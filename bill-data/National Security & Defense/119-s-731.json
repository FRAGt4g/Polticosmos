    "summary": "The 'Time to Choose Act of 2025' aims to prevent conflicts of interest among consulting firms that simultaneously contract with the U.S. government and covered foreign entities, including China and Russia. The bill mandates these firms to choose between contracting with the U.S. government or providing consulting services to these foreign entities. It directs the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to amend regulations to enforce this, requires self-certification, and allows for limited waivers under specific national security conditions. Penalties for false information and reporting requirements are included. This legislation seeks to safeguard U.S. national security and economic interests.",
