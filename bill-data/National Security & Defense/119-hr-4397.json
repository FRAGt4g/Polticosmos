    "summary": "This bill, the Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act of 2025, mandates the President to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization. It directs the Secretary of State to submit annual reports identifying Muslim Brotherhood branches and assessing whether their activities warrant designation under existing terrorism-related laws. The bill also imposes immigration restrictions on Muslim Brotherhood members and requires the President to apply sanctions against the organization and its branches, including those outlined in Executive Order 13224. Specifically, it amends the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 to broaden prohibitions related to terrorist organizations and their affiliates.",
