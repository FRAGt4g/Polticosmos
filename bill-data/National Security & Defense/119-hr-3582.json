    "summary": "This bill, the \"No Revolving Doors in FMS Act of 2025,\" aims to prevent former State Department and Department of Defense employees from lobbying the federal government on foreign military sales (FMS) matters. It amends U.S. Code to prohibit individuals who worked on FMS within three years of leaving government service from communicating with federal officials to influence FMS decisions. Violators face penalties. This aims to reduce potential conflicts of interest and ensure ethical conduct in foreign military sales.",
