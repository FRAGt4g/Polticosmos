    "summary": "This bill, the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2025, aims to limit the President's authority to initiate a first-use nuclear strike. It asserts that such a strike should only occur after a declaration of war by Congress. The bill cites constitutional principles regarding Congress's war-declaring power, the devastating impact of nuclear weapons, and the need for checks and balances on presidential authority. It prohibits the use of federal funds for a first-use nuclear strike unless authorized by a congressional declaration of war.",
