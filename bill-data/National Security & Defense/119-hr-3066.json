    "summary": "The Financial Integrity for National Security Act (FINS Act) aims to enhance financial oversight of commercial wire transfer companies like Western Union and Ria.  The bill seeks to prevent illicit money transfers used by criminal organizations, including cartels and terrorist groups. It amends existing law (31 U.S. Code \u00a75312(a)) to specifically include \"wire transfer service providers\" under regulatory scrutiny and mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to issue new rules within 180 days. The amendments become effective one year after enactment.",
