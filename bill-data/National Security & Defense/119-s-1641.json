    "summary": "This bill, the \"Reaffirming Every Servicemembers' Trust Of Religious Exemptions Act\" (RESTORE Act), addresses religious accommodation requests within the military. It mandates the Secretary of Defense to establish a Special Review Board to audit religious accommodation decisions related to the COVID-19 vaccine. The board will review service members' records, assess career impacts, and provide corrective actions, including backdated promotions, lost pay restoration, and record expungement. The bill also includes reporting requirements to Congress and requires an Inspector General audit. The goal is to restore fairness to service members who sought religious exemptions and ensure their career progression wasn't unjustly affected. Finally, it authorizes appropriations as necessary to enact this policy.",
