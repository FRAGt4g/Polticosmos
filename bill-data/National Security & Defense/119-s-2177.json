    "summary": "The No Adversarial AI Act aims to protect the U.S. government from artificial intelligence developed by foreign adversaries. It mandates the Federal Acquisition Security Council to create and regularly update a public list of such AI. Executive agencies are required to review and potentially exclude or remove AI provided by listed foreign adversary entities, with exceptions for research, evaluation, counterterrorism, or mission-critical functions. The bill defines key terms such as 'artificial intelligence', 'foreign adversary', and 'foreign adversary entity'.",
