    "summary": "The Waste and Illegal Property Eradication (WIPE) Act authorizes the Department of Defense to use expeditionary solid waste disposal systems to destroy illicit contraband, including counterfeit materials, unauthorized military gear, illegal narcotics, and classified materials. It prohibits the use of open-air burn pits for disposing of such materials. The bill provides $8,950,000 in additional funding in fiscal year 2026 for solid waste disposal systems, offset by a reduction in funds allocated for open-air burn pits in contingency operations.",
