It aims to ensure the government obtains the best value when procuring goods and services through the multiple award schedule program. The bill prioritizes the lowest cost alternative, but allows for the consideration of 'best value' \u2013 as defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation \u2013 when determined to be in the government's best interest. It differentiates between civilian and defense contracts.",
