    "summary": "The Nuclear First-Strike Security Act of 2025 aims to limit the President's ability to authorize first-use nuclear strikes. It prohibits the use of funds for these strikes unless the President deems it in the best interest of the US and the Secretary of Defense certifies the decision to Congress, with exceptions for declared wars, responses to nuclear attacks, and launch-on-warning scenarios. The bill defines key terms like 'ally of the United States' and 'first-use nuclear strike.'",
