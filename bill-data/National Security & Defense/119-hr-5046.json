It prohibits the consideration of race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in admissions. The bill also specifies how the composite score is calculated, including minimum weights for academic and standardized test scores, and requires annual reports to Congress regarding admissions, waivers, and cadet performance. It also makes alteration to the appointment of additional appointees to the academies.",
