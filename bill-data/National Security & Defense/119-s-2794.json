    "summary": "The DECLINE Act (Deactivating and Eliminating Cards Linked to Inactive or Nonexistent Employees Act) mandates federal agencies to establish policies for deactivating charge cards of departing employees. It defines key terms like \"agency,\" \"charge card,\" and \"covered individual\" and outlines requirements for returning, securing, and deactivating the cards.  The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit annual reports on agency compliance, including card deactivation data, internal controls, late fees, and management reporting practices.",
