    "summary": "The 'Reporting on Investments in Foreign Adversaries Act' (RIFA Act) amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require institutions of higher education with large endowments to disclose investments in 'foreign countries of concern' and 'foreign entities of concern.' This includes reporting purchases, sales, and holdings of such investments, as well as the fair market value of those investments. The bill mandates a searchable database of these reports and imposes penalties, including fines and potential ineligibility for government programs, for non-compliance. The Secretary of Education, in conjunction with other agencies, will enforce this regulation.",
