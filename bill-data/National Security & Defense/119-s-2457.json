    "summary": "The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2025 aims to authorize dedicated offices within the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and FBI to analyze, monitor, investigate, and prosecute domestic terrorism, focusing particularly on White supremacist and neo-Nazi threats. It mandates joint reports to Congress, including a quantitative analysis of domestic terrorism incidents, arrests, and prosecutions.  The bill also establishes a Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee, requires training for law enforcement, and sets up an interagency task force to address infiltration of uniformed services. It also supports community relations and designates FBI liaisons for hate crimes with a domestic terrorism nexus. The Act emphasizes civil rights protections.",
