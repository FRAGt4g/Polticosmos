    "summary": "The Aviation Risk Mitigation and Security Act (ARMS Act) directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to enhance aviation security. It mandates the establishment of covert testing programs to identify vulnerabilities in airport security operations, including passenger and baggage screening. The TSA must conduct risk assessments, perform covert tests, analyze vulnerabilities, and implement mitigation measures. Annual reports detailing the test results and a public summary of Category X airport performance data are required. The Comptroller General will review the TSA's covert testing effectiveness after three years.",
