    "summary": "The 'Pay Our Coast Guard Act' aims to ensure Coast Guard personnel, including military members, civilian employees, and contracted workers, continue to receive pay and benefits even during government funding lapses. The bill amends Title 14 of the United States Code to appropriate necessary funds for these purposes, including death gratuities and funeral expenses. It defines a 'Coast Guard-specific funding lapse' and sets conditions for the termination of these appropriations. The bill also includes a clerical amendment to update the chapter analysis.",
