    "summary": "This bill, the \"Silencers Help Us Save Hearing Act,\" aims to treat firearm silencers as accessories rather than regulated firearms. It amends sections of the Internal Revenue Code and Title 18 of the United States Code to remove or relax restrictions on silencers, preempt certain state laws regarding them, and revise definitions related to firearms. The bill seeks to deregulate silencers, eliminating requirements and penalties associated with their possession and transfer.",
