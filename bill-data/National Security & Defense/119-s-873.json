    "summary": "The Fighter Force Preservation and Recapitalization Act of 2025 aims to preserve and modernize the Air Force's fighter aircraft fleet. It mandates minimum aircraft inventory levels, allows for temporary reductions during recapitalization, and requires annual reports on the status of the fleet. The bill prioritizes the assignment of new fighter aircraft to service-retained squadrons and the Air National Guard, while also permitting the retirement of older aircraft. It further establishes an annual plan to recapitalize the Air National Guard's fighter fleet.",
