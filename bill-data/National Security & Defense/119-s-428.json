    "summary": "The 'Situational Awareness of Flying Elements in Orbit Act' (SAFE Orbit Act) aims to promote space situational awareness and space traffic coordination. It tasks the Secretary of Commerce with facilitating safe space operations by gathering and disseminating unclassified data, analytics, and services related to space activities. The bill grants immunity for providing these services, mandates a public database of satellite information, and requires the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Space Commerce to provide basic space situational awareness services while avoiding competition with the private sector. The bill also redefines key terms, elevates the Office of Space Commerce to a Bureau, and outlines its functions and leadership, including Presidential appointment of the Assistant Secretary.",
