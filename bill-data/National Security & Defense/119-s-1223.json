    "summary": "The bill, \"Prohibiting Foreign Adversary Interference in Cryptocurrency Markets Act,\" aims to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to prevent entities from foreign adversaries from interfering in U.S. digital commodity markets. It defines key terms like 'digital commodity' and 'foreign adversary,' and prohibits the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) from registering digital commodity platforms owned by covered entities (those based in or controlled by foreign adversaries listed in the bill). The bill also allows the Commission to revoke registration if a covered entity gains ownership.",
