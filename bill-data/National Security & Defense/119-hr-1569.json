    "summary": "This bill, known as the CATCH Fentanyl Act, mandates the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish pilot programs for testing and assessing technology enhancements to improve cargo inspections at U.S. land ports of entry. The goal is to detect contraband, including fentanyl, using technologies like AI and machine learning. The CBP Innovation Team will lead the projects, involving private sector input, and provide reports to Congress analyzing the effectiveness of the technologies, privacy impacts, and associated costs, specifically focusing on non-intrusive inspection methods.",
