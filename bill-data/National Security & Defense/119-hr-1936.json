    "summary": "The \"No Invading Allies Act\" (H.R. 1936) prohibits the use of U.S. Armed Forces funds for invading or seizing territory from Canada, Panama, or Greenland. It mandates congressional authorization, a declaration of war, or a national emergency due to an attack or imminent threat to the U.S. before such actions can be taken. The bill reaffirms the U.S.'s commitment to international order, alliances, and opposing territorial aggression, while also clarifying the definition of 'introduction of United States Armed Forces.'",
