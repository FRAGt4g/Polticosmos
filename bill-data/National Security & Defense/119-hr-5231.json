    "summary": "The 'Safe Airspace for Americans Act' mandates the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to create procedures for collecting, analyzing, and investigating incidents involving unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), reported by aviation personnel. It requires processes for reporting, data storage, and timely investigations, including archiving relevant data like pilot-controller communications. The bill also includes a communications strategy to engage the public and reduce stigma. The FAA must coordinate with other government agencies, and the Administrator will share information with the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office of the Department of Defense. It offers protections against reprisals for reporting UAPs and details definitions for the term. The bill is intended to ensure national airspace safety related to UAPs.",
