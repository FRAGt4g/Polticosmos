    "summary": "This bill, the Strengthening Cyber Resilience Against State-Sponsored Threats Act (H.R. 2659), aims to bolster the security of U.S. critical infrastructure. It mandates the establishment of an interagency task force, led by the Director of CISA and the FBI Director, to coordinate efforts to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats, specifically those from Chinese state-sponsored actors like Volt Typhoon. The task force will produce reports for Congress, including classified assessments of risks, the ability to counter threats, and recommendations for improvement. Reports will also cover the potential impact of a major crisis or conflict. The bill specifies the task force's structure, reporting requirements, and information access rules.",
