    "summary": "This bill, the Federal Ordinance Requiring Kitchenware Specifically Made in America Permanency Act of 2025 (or FORKS Made in America Permanency Act of 2025), aims to make permanent the existing requirement for the Secretary of Defense to procure stainless steel flatware and dinnerware from American sources. It does this by eliminating a sunset provision in a previous law related to this requirement. This ensures that the Department of Defense continues to purchase these specific kitchenware items from American manufacturers indefinitely.",
