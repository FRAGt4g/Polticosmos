    "summary": "The 'Critical Materials Future Act of 2025' establishes a pilot program to support domestic processing of critical materials. The program, run by the Secretary of Energy, will utilize innovative financial tools (e.g., contracts for difference) to attract investment, reduce supply chain vulnerabilities, and enhance energy and national security. The bill defines key terms, sets objectives for the pilot program, outlines application procedures, mandates coordination with other federal agencies, requires a study, and authorizes $750 million. The program will prioritize projects using domestic or reliable feedstocks.",
