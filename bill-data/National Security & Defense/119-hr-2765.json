    "summary": "The Securing America\u2019s Federal Equipment Supply Chains Act (H.R. 2765) mandates that the Department of Defense procure and use information and communications technology products only from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or authorized resellers. It defines key terms like \"covered product\" and \"authorized reseller.\" The bill allows for waivers under specific circumstances, such as for scientific research or to avoid jeopardizing mission-critical functions, requiring notification to congressional defense committees. It also requires the Secretary of Defense to report annually to Congress.  The act takes effect one year after enactment and doesn't authorize additional funding.",
