    "summary": "H.R. 454, the \"Safe Bases Act of 2025,\" directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a new system for issuing concealed carry permits to military personnel. Within one year of the bill's enactment, a single authority within the Department of Defense would be created to handle permit requests. These permits would authorize eligible, active-duty members of the Armed Forces to carry a concealed firearm on any military installation. To qualify, service members must not be prohibited from owning a firearm under existing federal law. The bill aims to allow qualified personnel to carry personal firearms on base.",
