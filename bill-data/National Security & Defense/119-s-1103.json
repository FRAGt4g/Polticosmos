    "summary": "The 'Vessel Tracking for Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2025' mandates a pilot program to use big data analytics to identify and predict vessels evading US sanctions and export controls. The Secretary of Homeland Security, through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, will lead the program at the National Targeting Center, collaborating with other agencies and partner nations. A report to Congress will assess the program's effectiveness, detailing interdictions, penalties, and vessel movements, and will recommend future use of big data analytics. The program is set to terminate 4 years after enactment.",
