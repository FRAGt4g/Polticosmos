    "summary": "The Stop Politicians Profiting from War Act of 2025 aims to prohibit members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from owning or trading stock in covered defense contractors. It defines covered defense contractors and specifies divestment timelines based on when a member enters Congress or receives such assets. Exceptions are made for widely held investment funds, certain Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act shares, and US Treasury bonds, among other things.  The bill also includes civil penalties for violations and addresses tax implications of required divestments, providing interpretive guidance.",
