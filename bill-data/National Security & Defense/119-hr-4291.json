    "summary": "The Sanctions Lists Harmonization Act mandates a review of individuals and entities subject to U.S. sanctions. It requires federal officials to notify each other upon inclusion on specific sanctions lists (e.g., OFAC's SDN list, Entity List) and to determine, within 90 days, whether to include those individuals or entities on other relevant lists. Federal agencies must report compliance to congressional committees within a year, detailing the review process and any additions made to the lists. The bill aims to improve coordination and ensure consistent application of sanctions.",
