    "summary": "The 'Procurement Reform for Immediate Military Equipment Act' (PRIME Act) aims to expedite the procurement process for experimental military equipment. It amends Title 10 of the United States Code to streamline the acquisition of prototypes, products, and supplies for defense. The bill allows for follow-on production contracts without competitive bidding if a combatant command deems the experimental item successful and intends to deploy it.",
