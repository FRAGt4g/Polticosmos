    "summary": "This bill authorizes the President to award the Medal of Honor to Thomas H. Griffin for his acts of valor as an Army captain during the Vietnam War. It details Griffin's actions from March 1-3, 1969, where he repeatedly risked his life to lead his battalion and direct combat operations against a North Vietnamese Army regiment. The bill highlights Griffin's actions, including numerous acts of bravery, disregard for personal safety, including being wounded three times, and his leadership culminating in his battalion's major win. It also addresses the prior awarding of a Silver Star and the recognition that the upgrade to the Medal of Honor is warranted due to the extent of his valor.",
