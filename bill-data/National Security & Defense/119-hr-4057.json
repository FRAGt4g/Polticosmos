    "summary": "This bill, the CBP Canine Home Kenneling Pilot Act, mandates the establishment of a pilot program within U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Field Operations to assess the benefits of home kenneling for canine teams. It outlines requirements for the pilot, including handler training, program duration, and port of entry participation. The Executive Assistant Commissioner must provide briefings and reports to Congress on the pilot's progress and findings, including cost-benefit analyses, job performance metrics and recommendations. The program seeks to compare home kenneling with centralized kennel practices.",
