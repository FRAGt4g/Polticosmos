    "summary": "This bill, the \"Limiting Immunity for Assisting Backers of Lethal Extremism Act\" (LIABLE Act), amends Title 28 of the United States Code to remove jurisdictional immunity from international organizations in certain terrorism-related cases. It allows U.S. courts to hear cases where an international organization is alleged to have caused personal injury or death through acts such as torture or material support for terrorism, committed by its officials or agents. The bill also specifies conditions for cases to be heard, including the organization's involvement with a designated foreign terrorist organization, and that the victim be a U.S. national or affiliated with the U.S. Government. Furthermore, it sets a 20-year statute of limitations.",
