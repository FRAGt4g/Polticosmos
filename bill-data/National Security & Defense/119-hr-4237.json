    "summary": "The SECURE Act (H.R. 4237) amends the National Security Act of 1947.  It clarifies due process protections for individuals whose security clearances are denied or revoked, replacing 'employees in the executive branch' with 'individuals'. The bill also mandates an annual report detailing the number of security clearance denials and revocations, including the employing agency, reasons for denial/revocation, and the outcome of any appeals. The bill aims to increase transparency and fairness in the security clearance process.",
