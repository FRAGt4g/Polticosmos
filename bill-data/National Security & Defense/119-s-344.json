    "summary": "This bill mandates the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to identify and repeatedly vet Afghan evacuees who were not fully vetted before entering the U.S. during Operation Allies Refuge and Operation Allies Welcome (July 2021-January 2022). It requires a full screening, including consultation of databases, and establishes periodic vetting processes, including interviews. The bill emphasizes prioritizing those without proper identification and mandates reporting on the vetting outcomes, including the number of ineligible evacuees and reasons for ineligibility.",
