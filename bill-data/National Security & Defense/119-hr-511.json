    "summary": "This bill, the \"AMERICANS Act of 2025\", provides remedies for U.S. Armed Forces members discharged or disciplined for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. It prohibits the Secretary of Defense from issuing a new COVID-19 vaccine mandate without express congressional authorization. The act requires the military to offer reinstatement, change discharges to \"honorable\", provide back pay, restore rank, and expunge adverse records for affected members. It also cancels any obligation for these former members to repay bonuses and mandates fair treatment and career opportunities for unvaccinated members who are still serving.",
