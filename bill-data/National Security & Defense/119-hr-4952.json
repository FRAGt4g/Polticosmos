    "summary": "The bill, the Ensuring Coast Guard Readiness Act, concerns the construction of Coast Guard vessels. It proposes an exception to the existing prohibition on building these vessels in foreign shipyards. The President could authorize exceptions if in the national security interest, provided the shipyard is in a NATO member country or a country with a mutual defense treaty with the U.S. and the cost is lower than domestic construction. The bill also includes requirements for notifying Congress and certifying that the foreign shipyard isn't Chinese-owned.",
