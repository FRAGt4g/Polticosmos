    "summary": "The 'Undoing and Nullifying Mandates so our Armed Services Keep Succeeding Act' (UNMASK Act) prohibits the federal government from requiring members of the Armed Forces to wear face masks while on active duty, unless required for specific duties involving personal protective equipment or safety. The bill cites the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency and the availability of vaccines as justification, arguing mask mandates undermine morale and the core mission of the Armed Forces. The Secretary of Defense retains the authority to enforce mask-wearing in specific operational or safety scenarios.",
