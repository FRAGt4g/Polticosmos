    "summary": "The Federal Contractor Cybersecurity Vulnerability Reduction Act of 2025 mandates that federal contractors implement a vulnerability disclosure policy consistent with NIST guidelines. It requires the Office of Management and Budget to recommend updates to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) regarding contractor vulnerability disclosure programs. The FAR Council must then amend the FAR to incorporate these requirements, aligning with existing cybersecurity standards where possible. Agencies can waive the requirement under specific conditions. The bill defines key terms and clarifies that no additional funding is authorized.",
