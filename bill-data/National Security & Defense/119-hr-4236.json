    "summary": "The Foreign Americium Disposal and Storage Act of 2025 (FADS Act) clarifies the Department of Energy's authority to dispose of foreign-origin fissile or radiological materials, specifically Russian-origin americium-241 sources, at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). The bill amends the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 to include the safe disposal of these materials, recognizing their potential use in radiological dispersal devices and aiming to accelerate their removal and reduce the risk. The bill highlights negligible impact on WIPP operations.",
