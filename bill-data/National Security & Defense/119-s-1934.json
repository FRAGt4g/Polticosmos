    "summary": "The Securing Energy Supply Chains Act aims to address national security concerns related to energy supply. It mandates the Secretary of Energy to create and regularly update an \"Energy Non-Procurement List\" identifying entities engaged in activities detrimental to U.S. interests. The bill prohibits the Department of Energy from contracting with entities on this list or those using their components unless exceptions are warranted. Furthermore, the Secretary must conduct a study on overlapping lists from various federal agencies related to entities of concern and make recommendations for harmonization. The bill emphasizes critical materials and batteries within the energy supply chain.",
