    "summary": "This bill, the Expanding Whistleblower Protections for Contractors Act of 2025, aims to protect whistleblowers, including contractors, from retaliation when reporting waste, fraud, and abuse related to government contracts. It amends existing laws (Title 10 and 41 of the United States Code) to broaden the definition of \u201cprotected individual\u201d and strengthen protections against reprisal, including prohibiting executive branch officials from requesting such actions. The bill also clarifies that rights and remedies related to whistleblower protection cannot be waived and are not subject to predispute arbitration agreements.",
