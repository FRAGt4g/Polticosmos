    "summary": "The 'Terrorist Watchlist Data Accuracy and Transparency Act' amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to improve the accuracy of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) terrorism screening information. It mandates quality assurance reviews of initial nominations to the terrorist watchlist and other terrorism databases. The bill also requires annual and random audits of nominations, notification of the FBI and NCTC of errors, and consultation with these agencies if corrections are not made. Finally, it mandates an annual report to Congress detailing the number of identities referred for corrections or retractions.",
