    "summary": "This bill, the OFAC Licensure for Investigators Act, mandates the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to create a pilot program allowing private firms to obtain licenses for conducting nominal financial transactions in support of their investigations. It requires the Director of OFAC to coordinate with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The firms must submit monthly reports detailing their activities. Furthermore, it mandates that OFAC provide reports and classified briefings to Congress, assessing the program's utility and including recommendations. The pilot program is set to terminate five years after its establishment.",
