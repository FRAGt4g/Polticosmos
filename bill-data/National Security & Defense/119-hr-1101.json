    "summary": "The Taxpayer Data Protection Act aims to restrict access to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's payment systems within the Treasury Department. It limits access to authorized personnel (employees, contractors) with performance standards met, and outlines stringent requirements for non-government individuals, including security clearances, ethics agreements, and training. The bill also mandates the Treasury Inspector General to investigate and report unauthorized access within 30 days, including risk assessments and descriptions of impacted payments.",
