    "summary": "This bill, the Resilient Low Earth Orbit Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Act, directs the Secretary of the Air Force to initiate a capability demonstration project. The project aims to develop and test a resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) system using low Earth orbit satellites. The project will involve awarding contracts to commercial entities (covered service providers) to demonstrate PNT capabilities that are resistant to jamming and spoofing, provide accurate timing, and can restore service rapidly. The Secretary will evaluate providers, conduct a briefing and report to congress on the project's progress, and consider follow-on production contracts. The goal is to provide a reliable PNT system independently of the Global Positioning System (GPS).",
