    "summary": "This bill, the William S. Knudsen Defense Remobilization Act, establishes a commission to examine and make recommendations regarding the United States' defense-industrial base. The commission will assess the current industrial capacity, identify supply chain issues, and recommend reforms to operational planning, procurement, and federal regulations. The goal is to ensure the U.S. can adequately produce necessary weapons systems, munitions, and supplies in the event of major conflicts, drawing parallels to the pre-World War II mobilization efforts.\n",
