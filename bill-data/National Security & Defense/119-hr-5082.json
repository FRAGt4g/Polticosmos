    "summary": "The Best Price for Our Military Act of 2025 aims to amend Title 10 of the United States Code concerning defense contracts. Specifically, the bill seeks to eliminate the 'late cost and pricing data submission defense', which allows contractors to avoid penalties for submitting updated cost data late. It modifies existing paragraphs and adds a new one to clarify circumstances where updates to cost or pricing data, submitted after the contract price agreement, are based on data older than 30 days. The primary goal is to improve pricing transparency and potentially lower costs for the military.",
