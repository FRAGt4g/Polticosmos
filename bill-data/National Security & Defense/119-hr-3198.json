    "summary": "The 'Intergovernmental Critical Minerals Task Force Act' establishes a task force to address U.S. reliance on critical minerals, particularly from China. The task force will involve federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments to assess risks, make recommendations to the President, and secure U.S. supply chains. The bill mandates reports to Congress, focusing on increasing domestic production, identifying alternatives, and strengthening international partnerships to reduce reliance on 'covered countries.' The Comptroller General will also conduct a study on the regulatory landscape of domestic supply chains.",
