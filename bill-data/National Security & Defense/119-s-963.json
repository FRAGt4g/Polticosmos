    "summary": "The 'Space National Guard Establishment Act of 2025' establishes a Space National Guard as a reserve component of the Space Force. It specifies participating states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, New York, Ohio), outlines composition including a Director, and transfers existing space operations personnel and units. The Act prohibits new construction of facilities and mandates briefings to Congress on implementation. It also amends U.S. Code to define the Space National Guard and its role within the military reserve structure.",
