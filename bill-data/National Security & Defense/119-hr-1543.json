    "summary": "This bill, the 'Equal and Uniform Treatment in the Military Act' (or EQUITY Act), aims to amend Title 10 of the United States Code to prohibit discrimination within the Department of Defense based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, gender identity, or sexual orientation. It defines key terms like 'gender identity' and 'sex' and clarifies that eligibility for service should be based on an individual's ability to meet occupational standards and specialty requirements. The bill references historical actions related to equality in the military and contrasts this with recent executive orders that it argues are discriminatory.",
