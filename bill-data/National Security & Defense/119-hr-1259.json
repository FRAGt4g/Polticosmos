    "summary": "The Global Demining Protection Act (H.R. 1259) mandates the U.S. Secretary of State to immediately resume programs related to demining, the clearance of unexploded ordnance, and the destruction of small arms. This is to be achieved by issuing a waiver, referencing Executive Order 14169, to allow the Department of State to restart these activities. The bill's aim is to address the global issue of landmines and unexploded ordnance.",
