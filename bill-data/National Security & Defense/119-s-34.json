    "summary": "The 'Justice for 9/11 Act' addresses the legal status of individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay for their involvement in the September 11th terrorist attacks. It nullifies prior plea agreements, allowing for potential trials, and stipulates that the death penalty is an available sentencing option. It further dictates specific conditions of confinement, including solitary confinement, no contact with foreign nationals, limited psychological treatment, and prohibits transfer to the continental U.S. or any other country.",
