    "summary": "The bill, known as the TRACKS Act, aims to track U.S. taxpayer dollars sent to adversarial countries and foreign entities of concern. It amends the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to require the disclosure of subawards made to entities in foreign countries of concern or foreign entities of concern. This includes defining \"covered subaward\" and mandating data disclosure by recipients, with the Director issuing guidance within 90 days to ensure consistency across agencies and recipients.",
