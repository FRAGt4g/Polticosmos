This program will evaluate the military utility of optionally piloted vehicle (OPV) rotary-wing aircraft in various scenarios, including contested environments and multi-domain operations. The program will also assess cost benefits, develop new tactics, and inform ongoing autonomy efforts. The Secretary is required to convert at least three existing rotary-wing aircraft to OPVs, conduct testing in designated airspace, and submit a report to relevant committees detailing progress, findings, and recommendations.",
