    "summary": "The Blue Angels Act, introduced in the House of Representatives, aims to codify the organization, mission, and location of the U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron (Blue Angels). The bill mandates the Navy to maintain the squadron in Pensacola, Florida, with a mission focused on supporting Navy recruiting and awareness. It requires the squadron to conduct at least two annual flight demonstrations in Pensacola and 60% of their training flights in Florida. Furthermore, it protects the squadron\u2019s size by preventing reductions to aircraft or personnel below July 31, 2025 levels. The requirements apply to each calendar year starting after the bill\u2019s enactment.",
