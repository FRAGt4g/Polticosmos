    "summary": "The Rare Earth Magnet Security Act of 2025 proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit for the domestic production of high-performance rare earth magnets. The credit amount is $20 per kilogram, increasing to $30 if a significant portion of the materials is domestically sourced. The bill includes phase-out provisions, definitions, and special rules regarding component sourcing from non-allied foreign nations. It also allows for elective payments and amends the general business credit, with an effective date for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
