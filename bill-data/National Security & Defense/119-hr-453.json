    "summary": "The \"Religious Insignia on Dog Tags Act\" (H.R. 453) directs the Secretary of Defense to update regulations within 90 days of the bill's enactment. This update will allow trademarks owned by the Department of Defense, such as military branch logos, to be combined with religious insignia on commercially sold dog tags. These items can then be sold by lawful trademark licensees. The bill also makes this policy change retroactively effective from September 13, 2013, addressing the commercial production of items featuring both military and religious symbols.",
