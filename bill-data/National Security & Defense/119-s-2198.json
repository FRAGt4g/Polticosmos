    "summary": "This bill, the \"Military in Law Enforcement Accountability Act,\" aims to limit the Department of Defense's (DoD) support for civilian law enforcement activities. It restricts such support to specific emergency scenarios (humanitarian crises, natural disasters, public health emergencies, attacks on critical infrastructure and against the US, and domestic terrorism incidents) and mandates Presidential justification to Congress. It also sets time limits for DoD support unless approved by a joint resolution of Congress. Furthermore, the bill prohibits simultaneous service in the DoD and civilian law enforcement, with exceptions for reserve members, and expands requirements for the Armed Forces when assisting civil authorities. Finally, it establishes a private right of action for those harmed by violations.",
