    "summary": "This bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a pilot program to prevent and mitigate terrorism using motor vehicles. The program involves developing uniform standards for information collection by rental agencies, providing threat assessments, distributing guidance on suspicious activity reporting (including training), providing technical assistance, and potentially establishing a procedure to check information against a watch list and notify the FBI of vehicle sales/rentals. The bill also mandates reports to Congress, addresses liability, and defines key terms like 'covered rental vehicle' and 'dealer/rental company'.",
