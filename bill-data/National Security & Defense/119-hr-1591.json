It grants the Director of the FBI the authority to make security clearance and access determinations for political appointees and special government employees within the Executive Office of the President. The bill mandates notification to the President and Congress if a clearance is denied, suspended, or revoked by the FBI. If the President overrides the FBI's determination, the President must provide a written explanation to Congress within 30 days.",
