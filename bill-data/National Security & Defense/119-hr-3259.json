    "summary": "The Post Quantum Cybersecurity Standards Act aims to advance the adoption of post-quantum cryptography standards. It amends the National Quantum Initiative Act and the Cyber Security Research and Development Act to direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to promote the deployment of these standards. This includes disseminating guidance, providing technical assistance to at-risk entities (like critical infrastructure providers), and potentially establishing a grant program to help organizations adopt the new standards and address quantum-related vulnerabilities. The bill also amends the Cyber Security Research and Development Act to include post-quantum cryptography in NSF research.",
