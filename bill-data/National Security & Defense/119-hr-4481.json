    "summary": "This bill, the Accelerate Revenue for Manufacturing and Sales Act (ARMS Act), amends the Arms Export Control Act to modify the Special Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF). It aims to streamline the sale of U.S. defense articles to allies and partners by strengthening and expanding the SDAF. The bill's proponents argue this will reduce delivery times, improve strategic credibility, support the defense industrial base, and enhance interoperability, ultimately aligning with U.S. national interests.",
