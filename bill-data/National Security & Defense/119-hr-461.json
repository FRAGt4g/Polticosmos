    "summary": "Introduced by Mr. Steube, H.R. 461, the 'Eliminate DEI in the Military Act,' seeks to prohibit the use of federal funds for any diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) activities. This ban applies to the Department of Defense, all branches of the Armed Forces, and national service academies, including the Military and Naval Academies. The bill defines 'DEI activity' broadly, covering trainings, programs, educational materials, employment positions, and appointments. The legislation's primary purpose is to defund and eliminate all DEI-focused initiatives and roles within the U.S. military establishment.",
