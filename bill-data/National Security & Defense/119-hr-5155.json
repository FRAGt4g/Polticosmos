    "summary": "The 'Warrior Right to Repair Act of 2025' aims to ensure the Department of Defense (DoD) has access to repair materials for goods procured through contracts. It mandates contractors provide fair and reasonable access to parts, tools, and information necessary for diagnosing, maintaining, and repairing equipment. The bill adds a new section to Title 10 of the United States Code, outlines definitions (e.g., 'fair and reasonable access', 'part', 'tool'), and requires the Comptroller General to report on its implementation. It also directs the Secretary of Defense to review and modify contracts to eliminate intellectual property restrictions hindering DoD's maintenance capabilities.",
