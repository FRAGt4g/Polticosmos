    "summary": "The Chip Security Act mandates the Secretary of Commerce to establish chip security mechanisms for integrated circuit products exported, re-exported, or transferred internationally. These mechanisms initially require location verification. The bill calls for an assessment to identify additional security measures, including methods to prevent tampering and unauthorized access. The Secretary is required to report to Congress on the assessment and implement further security measures if deemed necessary. The Act also grants enforcement authority to monitor and record the location and end-users of covered products, and requires annual assessments of new chip security mechanisms.",
