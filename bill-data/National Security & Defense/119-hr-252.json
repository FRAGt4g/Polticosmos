    "summary": "The Secure Our Ports Act of 2025 proposes an amendment to Title 46 of the U.S. Code to bolster national security. The bill would prohibit owners or operators of U.S. port facilities from entering into contracts for ownership, leasing, or operation with specific foreign entities. This ban applies to state-owned enterprises from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. It also extends to any foreign company that is even partially owned by one of these designated countries, aiming to prevent their control over or influence in critical American maritime infrastructure.",
