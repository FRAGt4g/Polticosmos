    "summary": "The Transparency in Contracting Act of 2025 mandates reporting of price increases on noncompetitive contracts within the U.S. government. Contractors must report price hikes exceeding specified thresholds (25% above the bid price/prior year's price or 50% above the price from 5 years prior). Noncompliance information, including contractor details and audit findings, will be added to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS). The bill aims to increase transparency in government spending.",
