    "summary": "The 'Ensuring Coast Guard Readiness Act' addresses the construction of Coast Guard vessels. It allows the President to authorize exceptions to the prohibition on building Coast Guard vessels in foreign shipyards if it's in the national security interest and the construction cost is lower than in a domestic shipyard. Exceptions are limited to shipyards in NATO member countries or those with mutual defense treaties with the U.S. The President must notify Congress of any such determination, and the Commandant must certify the shipyard isn't controlled by a Chinese entity. The bill also includes a conforming amendment.",
