It mandates the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to annually review, update, and report on sensitive U.S. government facilities and property, including those of the intelligence community and national laboratories, focusing on national security and critical infrastructure, including drinking water. The bill also requires annual reviews by CFIUS members and classified briefings for members of Congress. This aims to bolster security regarding sensitive U.S. facilities.",
