    "summary": "This bill, the District of Columbia National Guard Home Rule Act, aims to grant the Mayor of the District of Columbia the same authority over the D.C. National Guard that state governors have over their state National Guards. It makes numerous amendments to federal laws (Titles 10, 32 of the U.S. Code) and the D.C. Official Code, primarily by substituting the Mayor of D.C. for the President of the United States or the Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard in various administrative and oversight roles related to the National Guard.",
