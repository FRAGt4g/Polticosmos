    "summary": "The Peace Through Strength Act of 2025 proposes to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War. The bill argues that this change will signal the nation's strength and resolve, enhancing the focus on national interests and deterring adversaries. It amends the United States Code to reflect the name change, impacting all existing references and related titles within the department and its officials while emphasizing that statutory references will remain controlling until changed by law, and that implementation will be subject to applicable law and available appropriations.",
