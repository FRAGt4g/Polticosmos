It requires intelligence community elements to assess their relationships with Mexican entities, develop strategies to strengthen counter-narcotics cooperation, and recommend resource allocations. The DNI is then required to submit these elements' submissions, along with a comprehensive action plan, to congressional intelligence committees, detailing proposed changes in authorities or resources needed for effective implementation in fiscal year 2026.
