    "summary": "The 'Ensuring Naval Readiness Act' amends U.S. Code Title 10 to allow for the construction of naval vessels in foreign shipyards under certain conditions. The primary change involves an exception to the prohibition on building naval vessels abroad. This exception is contingent upon the shipyard being in a NATO member country or a mutual defense treaty partner in the Indo-Pacific Region, and the cost being less than domestic construction. Furthermore, the Secretary of the Navy must certify to Congress that the foreign shipyard is not connected to Chinese entities before construction can begin.",
