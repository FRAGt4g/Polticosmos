    "summary": "This bill, the \"DHS Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act,\" aims to restrict Department of Homeland Security funding to U.S. institutions of higher education that maintain relationships with Confucius Institutes, the Thousand Talents Program, or Chinese entities of concern. It defines \"Chinese entity of concern\" based on criteria related to military-civil fusion, support for the Chinese government, and activities detrimental to U.S. interests. The Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure that institutions with such relationships are ineligible for funding unless they terminate those relationships. The Secretary is also required to report on institutions with relevant relationships that receive DHS funds.",
