    "summary": "The Qualified to Serve Act aims to standardize medical accession standards for the Armed Forces, ensuring consistency and transparency. It mandates the establishment of uniform medical standards across all branches, making them readily accessible to potential recruits. The bill prohibits disqualification based solely on past medical diagnoses (before age 13) under specific conditions. It also outlines a review/waiver process for medical disqualifications and requires an annual report to Congress on medical disqualifications and waivers.  ",
