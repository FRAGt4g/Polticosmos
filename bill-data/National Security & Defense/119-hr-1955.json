    "summary": "The Arsenal Workload Sustainment Act mandates the establishment of a five-year pilot program within the Department of Defense to bolster workload at Army-owned and operated arsenals. It directs the Secretary of Defense to prioritize non-public partners in procurement processes who partner with these arsenals. The bill also requires a report to Congress detailing workload, future needs, expected workload, and required capital investments. The act aims to ensure cost efficiency, technical competence, and readiness within the organic industrial base, and considers the National Defense Industrial Strategy.",
