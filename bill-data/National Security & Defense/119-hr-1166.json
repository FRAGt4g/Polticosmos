    "summary": "This bill, the Decoupling from Foreign Adversarial Battery Dependence Act, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from procuring batteries from specified foreign entities, primarily those with ties to China. It defines which entities are prohibited, including companies like CATL and BYD, as well as those on restricted lists related to forced labor and national security. The Secretary of Homeland Security can waive this prohibition under specific conditions, such as if no comparable alternatives exist. The bill also mandates a report on the impact of this restriction on the Department's operations and costs.",
