    "summary": "The 'Readiness Over Wokeness Act' (H.R. 3406) prohibits individuals with gender dysphoria from serving in the Armed Forces. It mandates the administrative discharge of current service members who meet this criteria and waives requirements for reimbursement of educational benefits or completion of service obligations for those separated under this provision. It also requires reinvestigation of security clearances for those discharged and potentially revokes clearances if they don't participate or no longer require them.",
