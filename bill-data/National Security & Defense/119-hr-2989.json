    "summary": "The 'Time to Choose Act of 2025' aims to prevent conflicts of interest involving consulting firms that contract with both the U.S. government and covered foreign entities (e.g., China, Russia, entities supporting international terrorism). The bill mandates certifications to avoid such conflicts, and prohibits awarding federal consulting contracts to firms simultaneously aiding these foreign entities. It allows for limited waivers with stringent requirements, including national security justifications, congressional notification, and reporting obligations. Penalties for false information include contract termination or debarment, and potential False Claims Act violations.",
