    "summary": "The 'Warrior Right to Repair Act of 2025' mandates that contractors providing goods to the Department of Defense (DoD) grant the DoD fair and reasonable access to repair materials, including parts, tools, and information. This access should be equivalent to the terms given to authorized repair providers. The bill includes provisions for waivers for existing programs and requires a report from the Comptroller General on implementation. Further, it directs the Secretary of Defense to identify and address contract modifications needed to remove intellectual property constraints hindering DoD's maintenance capabilities.",
