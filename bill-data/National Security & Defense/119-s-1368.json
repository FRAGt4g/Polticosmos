    "summary": "The TSP Fiduciary Security Act of 2025 aims to protect national security concerning the Thrift Savings Fund (TSP). It amends Title 5 of the United States Code to ensure that TSP investments and voting rights do not harm national security, particularly by prohibiting investments in entities linked to the People's Republic of China and those that could undermine national defense. The bill mandates reviews by the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with other agencies, and requires annual reports to Congress. It also restricts the TSP mutual fund window from investing in Chinese-based entities.",
