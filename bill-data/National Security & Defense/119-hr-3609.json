    "summary": "The \"Remove the Stain Act\" seeks to rescind the Medals of Honor awarded to soldiers of the U.S. 7th Cavalry for their actions at the Wounded Knee Massacre on December 29, 1890. The bill cites findings regarding the massacre, the historical context, and resolutions from Native American organizations. It mandates the removal of these recipients' names from the Medal of Honor Roll and clarifies that no individual is required to return the medal, and that federal benefits should not be denied. Primarily, it focuses on the integrity of the Medal of Honor and correcting a perceived historical injustice.",
