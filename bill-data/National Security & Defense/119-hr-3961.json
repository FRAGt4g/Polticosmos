    "summary": "This bill, HR 3961, prohibits the Secretary of Defense from contracting for software source code with entities that have certain relationships with China. This includes entities that own or operate facilities in China involved in AI research, entities that allow China access to the software that could be reverse-engineered, and entities operating data centers in China related to the source code. The Secretary can waive this prohibition if it's in the national security interest. The Act defines key terms like 'covered country' and 'material interest' and specifies this applies to contracts within three years of enactment.",
