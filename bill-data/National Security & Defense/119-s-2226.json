    "summary": "The 'Necessary Environmental Exemptions for Defense Act' (S. 2226) proposes to exempt the Department of Defense from certain environmental protection laws (National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and Federal Water Pollution Control Act) for activities related to countering the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. This includes readiness, training, construction, and technology development. The Secretary of Defense can certify activities for exemption.  The bill also precludes judicial review of these exemptions, makes the exemptions retroactive, and mandates a review of environmental best practices every five years.",
