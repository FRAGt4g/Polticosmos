    "summary": "The Secure Our Embassies Act (H.R. 4891) addresses the increasing complexities of security threats at U.S. diplomatic posts. The bill emphasizes the importance of coordination between security personnel (RSOs, DTOs, RSEOs, and OBO personnel) and mandates appropriate counterintelligence (CI) and regional security training. It also supports joint training modules to foster shared security responsibilities. The Secretary of State is required to submit a report to Congress within 180 days detailing actions taken and planned to improve coordination and implement CI training standards.",
