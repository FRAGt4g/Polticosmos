    "summary": "The 'America First Equipment and Information Act' aims to restrict U.S. assistance to Russia, citing aggressive actions by the Russian Federation as a threat to national security. The bill prohibits various forms of military and intelligence sharing with Russia, including Foreign Military Financing, Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales, as well as the sharing of classified information. It mandates an annual report to Congress detailing compliance. The core goal is to prevent U.S. military resources and intelligence from falling into the hands of adversaries.",
