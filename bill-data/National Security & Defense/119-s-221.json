    "summary": "This bill, the Extending Limits of United States Customs Waters Act of 2025, aims to extend the U.S. customs waters from 12 nautical miles to 24 nautical miles from the baselines, consistent with Presidential Proclamation 7219. It argues this extension is necessary to improve law enforcement's ability to interdict vessels violating U.S. laws, particularly those using modern technology to evade authorities. The bill amends the Tariff Act of 1930 and the Anti-Smuggling Act to reflect this change in jurisdiction.",
