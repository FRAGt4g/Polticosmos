    "summary": "The \"Parris Island Protection Act\" is a bill that aims to prevent the closure or realignment of the Marine Corps Recruit Depot at Parris Island, South Carolina. It explicitly prohibits the use of any federal funds for such actions, including any related planning activities. The bill highlights the depot's historical and cultural significance since 1891, its crucial role in training Marines for every major conflict since WWI, and seeks to ensure it remains the physical home of the Marine Corps' Eastern Recruiting Region.",
