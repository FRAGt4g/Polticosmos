    "summary": "The 'Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2025' aims to limit the President's authority to launch a first-use nuclear strike. The bill asserts that such a strike without a Congressional declaration of war would violate the Constitution. It prohibits the use of federal funds for a first-use strike unless explicitly authorized by a Congressional declaration of war. The bill defines a \"first-use nuclear strike,\" focusing on strikes not in response to a prior nuclear attack against the U.S. or its allies, thus seeking to increase Congressional oversight of nuclear weapon usage.",
