    "summary": "The Restoring Merit in the Military Act (H.R. 5025) aims to ensure that military personnel decisions are based solely on merit, fitness, and performance.  The bill prohibits consideration of race, ethnicity, or national origin in personnel actions, with a limited exception for specific, unconventional missions in foreign countries where such factors might enhance mission success, requiring combatant commander approval and reporting to Congressional committees. The act is intended to promote equal opportunity and racial neutrality within the Department of Defense.",
