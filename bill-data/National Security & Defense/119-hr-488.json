    "summary": "This bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General to combat the use of social media and online platforms by transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) for recruiting individuals in the U.S. It requires them to first submit a joint assessment of how TCOs use these platforms for illicit activities like drug and human trafficking. Following the assessment, they must develop and implement a national strategy to counter this recruitment, which includes improving inter-agency and international cooperation, creating a voluntary reporting process, and conducting youth outreach, while ensuring the protection of privacy and civil liberties.",
