    "summary": "This bill, the Service Enlistment and Recruitment of Valuable Engagement Act (SERVE Act), aims to bolster military recruitment. It focuses on improving access to high school students for military recruiters, including more frequent visits and access to student information like grades and gender. The bill also establishes different affiliation types for Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) programs, creates a pilot program to recognize military-friendly schools, and provides priority consideration for military service academy applicants from high schools with above-average enlistment rates. Additionally, it designates a National Week of Military Recruitment and mandates several reports to Congress related to these initiatives.",
