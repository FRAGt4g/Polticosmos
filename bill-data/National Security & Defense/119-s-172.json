    "summary": "The 'Stopping Adversarial Tariff Evasion Act' aims to clarify the country of origin for imported goods to strengthen trade enforcement actions against 'foreign adversary parties.' It amends existing trade laws to define how actions apply to articles produced by or associated with entities from countries like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela. These amendments impact actions related to trade agreements, import injury determinations, and national security safeguards. The bill broadens the definition of 'foreign adversary party' to include entities with significant ties to these countries.",
