    "summary": "This bill, the Foreign Adversary Communications Transparency Act, mandates the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to publish a list of entities holding FCC authorizations or licenses with foreign ownership from specified \"covered countries.\" The FCC must initially list entities with licenses under specific acts, and later, via rulemaking, add entities holding other authorizations. The bill requires annual updates to the list and defines key terms like \"covered country\" and \"covered entity.\" It aims to increase transparency regarding foreign influence on communications infrastructure.",
