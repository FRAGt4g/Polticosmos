    "summary": "The No Support for Terror Act aims to prevent financial resources from reaching terrorist organizations. It directs the U.S. to vote against providing International Monetary Fund (IMF) Special Drawing Rights to countries that are perpetrators of genocide or state sponsors of terrorism. The bill also requires the Treasury, State Department, and USAID to review U.S. assistance to ensure funds are not diverted to the Taliban or other terrorist groups. Additionally, it mandates that primary aid recipients verify their sub-awardees are compliant with U.S. anti-terrorism financing laws.",
