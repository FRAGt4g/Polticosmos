    "summary": "The Integrated Cross-Border Law Enforcement Operations Expansion Act aims to enhance cooperation between the U.S. and Canada on cross-border law enforcement. The bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to negotiate agreements for integrated aerial, land, and maritime operations. It amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to allow extending privileges and immunities to foreign officers and permits the use of funds for tort claims in foreign countries. It also allows for stationing law enforcement personnel in either country to enhance border security.",
