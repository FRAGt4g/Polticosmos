    "summary": "The 'Stop the Cartels Act' aims to combat drug trafficking organizations. Key provisions include: intelligence gathering on cartels in foreign countries, including assessments of their impact on migration and illicit financing. It addresses intelligence sharing agreements, reviews U.S.-Mexico cooperation, and authorizes the designation of cartels as Special Transnational Criminal Organizations, enabling asset freezes and penalties. The bill also includes measures related to immigration, such as ending family separation, addressing asylum fraud, increasing immigration judges and attorneys, and establishing refugee application processing centers. Finally, the bill repurposes federal drug programs, increasing funding for substance abuse treatment while eliminating funding for several other related programs.",
