    "summary": "The 'State Accountability for Federal Deployment Costs Act of 2025' mandates that states reimburse the federal government for costs incurred when federal military forces are deployed to address civil disturbances or security threats resulting from a state's non-cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The bill specifies that reimbursement covers costs like travel, lodging, and transportation of military personnel. The Secretary of Homeland Security determines a state's non-cooperation, and failure to pay allows the President to offset the debt by rescinding federal grants to the non-compliant state.",
