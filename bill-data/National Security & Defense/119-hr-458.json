    "summary": "The 'Protecting our Land Act' (H.R. 458) proposes to prohibit foreign adversaries and state sponsors of terrorism from purchasing public or private real estate within the United States. The bill directs the President to have federal agencies create rules and regulations to enforce this ban. The prohibition extends to any agents, instrumentalities, or affiliated persons of these designated foreign entities. The act defines a 'foreign adversary' as a foreign entity engaged in conduct adverse to U.S. national security and references existing legal definitions for 'state sponsor of terrorism'.",
