    "summary": "The 'Protecting Military Installations and Ranges Act of 2025' focuses on national security. It amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to require the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review real estate purchases or leases near military installations and airspace by foreign entities connected to or subsidized by Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea. The bill also places limitations on the approval of energy projects located near these sensitive areas while CFIUS reviews are ongoing or if national security concerns are raised.",
