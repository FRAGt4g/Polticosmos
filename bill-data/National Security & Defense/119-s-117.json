    "summary": "This bill, the AMERICANS Act of 2025, addresses remedies for members of the Armed Forces impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. It prohibits future mandates, provides honorable discharges, reinstatement, and compensation for those discharged or adversely affected due to vaccine refusal. It mandates expungement of records, and requires the Department of Defense to retain unvaccinated members, provide equal opportunities, and consider vaccination status only when required by foreign laws or regulations. It also eliminates the obligation for former members to repay bonuses and provides reimbursement for those who already did.",
