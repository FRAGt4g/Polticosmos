    "summary": "The Strategic Ports Reporting Act mandates the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State to monitor the People's Republic of China's (PRC) efforts to acquire or control strategic foreign ports. The bill requires the development of a global map of significant ports for the U.S., identifies PRC involvement, and mandates a comprehensive study on the implications of PRC control over these ports. The study must assess national security and economic risks, analyze PRC strategies, and recommend measures to secure trusted investment, protect ports from PRC influence, and ensure open access to strategic ports. The report also suggests a strategy for federal agencies to maintain an updated list of strategic ports.",
