It mandates the Secretary of the Air Force to procure advanced capability and fifth-generation fighter aircraft until all legacy aircraft in covered units are replaced.  The bill includes a GAO review and report on aircraft procurement challenges and a feasibility study on advanced capability fighter aircraft needs. It defines key terms like 'advanced capability fighter aircraft' and 'covered Air National Guard fighter unit.'",
