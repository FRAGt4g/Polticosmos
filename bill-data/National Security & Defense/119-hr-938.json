    "summary": "The 'No Contracts with Foreign Adversaries Act' amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prohibit institutions from entering into contracts with 'foreign countries of concern' or 'foreign entities of concern.' It outlines a waiver process allowing institutions to request permission from the Secretary to enter into such contracts, subject to conditions like promoting the institution's mission and U.S. security. The bill defines relevant terms, sets compliance officer requirements, and details enforcement mechanisms, including fines and potential program ineligibility for violations.",
