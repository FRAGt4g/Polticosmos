    "summary": "The bill, the Protecting Public Naval Shipyards Act of 2025, aims to prevent workforce reductions at public shipyards. It exempts these shipyards' workforce, including various positions like welders and engineers, from hiring freezes or reductions related to spending cuts. The bill defines the specific positions protected and clarifies that the Secretary of Defense retains authority to manage the workforce for misconduct or poor performance.",
