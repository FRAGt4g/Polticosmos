    "summary": "The Gun Violence Prevention Through Financial Intelligence Act mandates the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to issue an advisory on how domestic terrorists and homegrown violent extremists procure firearms and accessories. FinCEN will request information from financial institutions to develop the advisory, consulting with the FBI, ATF, and firearm sellers. The bill defines key terms like 'firearm accessory' and 'homegrown violent extremist'.  If sufficient information is gathered, an advisory will be issued within 540 days; if not, a report to congressional committees is required.",
