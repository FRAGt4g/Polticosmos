    "summary": "The Promoting Agriculture Safeguards and Security Act (PASS Act) amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to enhance the review process of agricultural transactions by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). It mandates CFIUS to scrutinize acquisitions of U.S. agricultural land and businesses by foreign entities, particularly those from countries deemed as foreign adversaries, potentially leading to prohibitions on transactions that could pose national security risks near critical U.S. government facilities. The President can waive prohibitions in the national interest. The bill also specifies reporting requirements and regulation timelines.",
