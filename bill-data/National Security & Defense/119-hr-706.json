It mandates an assessment of DHS's current use of Department of Energy (DOE) national labs for biodetection R&D, and directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a strategy for future collaborations. This strategy must address biodetection technology identification, acquisition plans, external evaluations, and partnerships with various entities to define program requirements.
