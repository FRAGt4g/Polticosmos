    "summary": "This bill, the \"Fourth Amendment Restoration Act,\" proposes the complete repeal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA). It seeks to enhance privacy protections for U.S. citizens by requiring a standard warrant from a Federal court for any electronic surveillance or physical search conducted to gather foreign intelligence. The act also prohibits the use of information about U.S. citizens\u2014whether gathered under Executive Order 12333 or collected incidentally\u2014in any legal proceedings against them. Furthermore, it establishes criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, for conducting surveillance on U.S. citizens without proper authorization.",
