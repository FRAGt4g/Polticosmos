    "summary": "The Defense Workforce Integration Act of 2025 aims to integrate military and civilian career pathways within the Department of Defense. It mandates the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with relevant Secretaries, to create a program allowing medically disqualified entry-level service members to access civilian positions. The bill also directs the Secretary of Defense to provide information on defense industry job opportunities to individuals ineligible for military service and requires the Secretary of the Navy to inform Navy personnel about career options at Military Sealift Command. A report on the implementation of these initiatives is also mandated.",
