    "summary": "The 'Limiting Liability for Critical Infrastructure Manufacturers Act' aims to shield manufacturers of critical infrastructure equipment from liability in wildfire incidents. The bill grants immunity from lawsuits under federal and state law, unless willful misconduct in the equipment's design or production is proven. It defines critical infrastructure according to the USA PATRIOT Act and defines 'manufacturer' based on the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022.",
