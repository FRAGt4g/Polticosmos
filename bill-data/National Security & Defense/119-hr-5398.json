    "summary": "The Pay Our Homeland Defenders Act of 2026 aims to ensure that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel, including law enforcement, employees, contractors, and members of the Coast Guard, continue to receive pay and allowances during government shutdowns in fiscal years 2026 or 2027. The bill appropriates necessary funds for this purpose until a new appropriation is enacted, preventing disruptions in essential services. The Act covers a wide range of DHS functions, including administrative and payroll roles.",
