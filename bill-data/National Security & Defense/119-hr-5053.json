    "summary": "The 'Protecting Public Naval Shipyards Act of 2025' aims to protect the workforce at public shipyards from reductions due to spending cuts or other budgetary constraints. It defines 'workforce' to include various positions like welders, engineers, and support staff. It excludes instances of misconduct or poor performance, allowing the Secretary of Defense to maintain existing workforce management procedures for those reasons. The bill aims to safeguard jobs within the naval shipyard system.",
