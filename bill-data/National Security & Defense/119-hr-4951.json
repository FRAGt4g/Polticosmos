    "summary": "The Ensuring Naval Readiness Act (HR 4951) proposes an exception to the prohibition on constructing naval vessels in foreign shipyards. It allows for construction in shipyards located in NATO member countries or countries in the Indo-Pacific Region with mutual defense treaties with the U.S., provided the cost is lower than domestic construction. Furthermore, before construction, the Secretary of the Navy must certify that the foreign shipyard is not owned or operated by a Chinese company. This bill focuses on enhancing the Navy's readiness by potentially leveraging foreign shipbuilding capabilities.",
