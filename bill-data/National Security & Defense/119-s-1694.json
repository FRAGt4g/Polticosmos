    "summary": "The bill, the DHS Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act, aims to restrict Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding to institutions of higher education that have relationships with Confucius Institutes or Chinese entities of concern. These entities of concern are defined by their involvement in military-civil fusion, the Chinese defense industrial base, affiliations with certain Chinese governmental bodies, or providing support to Chinese security or intelligence organizations. The bill mandates that institutions terminate these relationships to remain eligible for DHS funding.",
