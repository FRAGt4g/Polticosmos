    "summary": "This bill, the 'Armed Forces Endangered Species Exemption Act,' amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973. It prohibits the designation of military installations and other defense-related lands as critical habitat for protected species. It removes the requirement for the Secretary of Defense to consult with the Secretary of the Interior on actions affecting these lands. The bill also creates broad exemptions for military personnel and contractors, allowing for the 'taking' of endangered or threatened species if it results from national defense-related operations, which are broadly defined by the Secretary of Defense.",
