    "summary": "This bill amends the National Emergencies Act to limit presidential power. It requires a presidentially-declared national emergency to be affirmed by a joint resolution of Congress within 30 days, or else it automatically terminates. The bill further establishes that approved emergencies expire after two years unless the President renews the emergency and Congress again passes a joint resolution affirming the renewal. It also details the process for winding down terminated emergencies, including the return of unobligated funds, and applies these new renewal rules to emergencies declared before the Act's passage.",
