    "summary": "The Arsenal Workload Sustainment Act (S.905) mandates the Department of Defense to establish a five-year pilot program to support arsenals owned and operated by the U.S. government. The bill prioritizes these arsenals in procurement, providing a 20% price preference for partners utilizing them. It also favors partners using the Army's Advanced Manufacturing Center of Excellence and having at least 25% DoD employee participation. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress annually on the program, including workload data, budget assessments, and capital investment needs. The goal is to ensure cost efficiency, technical competence, and readiness within the organic industrial base, especially critical in times of mobilization or national emergency.",
