    "summary": "This bill, the Strengthening Targeting of Organized Predatory Scammers Act (STOP Scammers Act), mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to designate foreign entities engaging in fraudulent activities targeting U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents as \"Foreign Financial Threat Organizations.\"  It outlines procedures for designation, including notification to Congress and publication in the Federal Register.  Designation triggers asset freezing, penalties similar to those for terrorist organizations, and actions to restrict access to internet/cellular services.  The bill requires annual reports on implementation, including assets seized and funds returned to victims. The Secretary of Treasury is also expected to take actions to prevent contact from these organizations.",
