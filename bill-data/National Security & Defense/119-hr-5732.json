    "summary": "The Keep Air Travel Safe Act (H.R. 5732) addresses funding for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) during government shutdowns. It mandates the TSA to continue all its activities, using unobligated balances from a prior law, ensuring essential services are maintained. Funding levels follow the previous fiscal year's appropriation rate or a continuing resolution rate, with specified availability periods and conditions. If a shutdown extends into a new fiscal year these funding levels will continue until a new bill is passed. The act aims to prevent disruptions to air travel security during lapses in appropriations.",
