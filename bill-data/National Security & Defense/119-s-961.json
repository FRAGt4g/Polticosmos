    "summary": "The Protect Our Military Families\u2019 2nd Amendment Rights Act aims to ensure that members of the Armed Forces and their spouses have the same rights regarding firearms at the location of the service member's duty station. It amends existing federal law to clarify that military spouses have the same rights as service members to receive firearms. Additionally, the bill clarifies residency requirements for military spouses in relation to federal firearms laws, determining residency based on the same criteria as for service members. The changes will go into effect 180 days after the bill is enacted.",
