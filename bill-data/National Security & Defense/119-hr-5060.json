The bill amends existing laws to extend whistleblower protections to civilian employees, FBI agents, Department of Defense personnel and contractors, federal contractors, and members of the intelligence community who report on this topic. The bill's main goal is to promote transparency regarding government spending on UAP-related activities.",
