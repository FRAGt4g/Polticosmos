    "summary": "The 'Drug Testing for Special Government Employees Act' mandates drug testing for individuals seeking or currently serving as special government employees in sensitive positions. Prospective employees must pass a drug test before their first day. Current employees in sensitive roles are subject to random drug testing. Failing a drug test results in ineligibility for future employment, and removal from civil service for current employees. The bill defines key terms like 'controlled substance,' 'agency,' 'sensitive position,' and 'special Government employee'.",
