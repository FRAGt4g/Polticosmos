    "summary": "The Secret Service Recording Accountability Act of 2025 mandates the Secret Service to record all communications between agents protecting individuals entitled to such protection. These recordings are to be retained for at least 90 days, but longer if requested by specific congressional committees. In cases of harm or attempted harm to the protected person, the recordings must be made available to designated committees. The bill's aim is transparency and accountability within the Secret Service.",
