    "summary": "This bill, the 'Six Assurances to Taiwan Act,' aims to codify the Six Assurances, a set of U.S. foreign policy principles regarding Taiwan. It mandates congressional review of presidential actions related to Taiwan, particularly those impacting arms sales, mediation roles, sovereignty positions, and pressure on Taiwan. The bill outlines procedures for joint resolutions of approval or disapproval and restricts the use of funds for actions the President might take, with significant implications if the President attempts to significantly alter policy. It reinforces existing legal commitments to Taiwan.",
