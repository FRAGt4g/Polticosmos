    "summary": "The Taiwan Relations Reinforcement Act of 2025 aims to strengthen U.S. policy toward Taiwan. It calls for enhanced cooperation under the Taiwan Relations Act, promotes Taiwan's inclusion in international organizations, and prioritizes a free-trade agreement. The bill establishes an interagency task force, addresses PRC's influence efforts, and prohibits recognition of PRC claims over Taiwan without the people's assent. It also mandates reports on deterrence in the Taiwan Strait and strategies to counter PRC 'sharp power' operations like disinformation and economic coercion.",
