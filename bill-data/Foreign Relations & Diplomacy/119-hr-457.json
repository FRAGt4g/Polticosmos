    "summary": "The Passport Notification Act of 2025 requires the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs to proactively notify United States citizens about their passport's upcoming expiration. No later than 180 days before a passport expires, the citizen must receive a notification, either electronically or by mail. This notice will include the expiration date and information on how to renew the passport, including locations for submitting renewal materials. This rule will apply to all passports expiring 180 days or more after the bill becomes law, aiming to help citizens avoid unexpected lapses in their travel documents.",
