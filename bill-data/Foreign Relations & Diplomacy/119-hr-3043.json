    "summary": "The Accountability in Foreign Animal Research Act (H.R. 3043) prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from using taxpayer dollars to fund biomedical research or experimentation on vertebrate animals in specific foreign countries. These countries include China (including Hong Kong), Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The bill also allows the Secretary to designate additional countries of concern in consultation with the Secretaries of State and Defense. The Secretary must report to Congress on each such designation. The bill aims to limit taxpayer funded animal experimentation in adversarial nations.",
