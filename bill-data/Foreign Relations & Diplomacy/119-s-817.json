    "summary": "The Falun Gong Protection Act seeks to impose sanctions on individuals and entities involved in forced organ harvesting in China. It mandates the President to create a list of offenders and enact sanctions, including blocking property and denying visas. The bill also requires a report on China's organ transplant practices and policies and defines several terms. It contains exceptions for humanitarian aid, national security, and importation of goods and sets a sunset clause for the sanctions. The bill focuses on cooperation with the international community and seeks to condemn the Chinese government's persecution of Falun Gong.",
