    "summary": "The American Investment Accountability Act mandates reporting on U.S. investments in entities controlled by foreign adversaries. It defines key terms like \"country of concern\" (including China, Russia, Iran, etc.) and \"covered entities.\" The bill requires the Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to submit regular reports to Congress detailing these investments, disaggregated by sector and accounting for offshore financial centers, and identifying specific transactions exceeding certain thresholds.  The aim is to monitor and increase transparency around U.S. investment activities that might pose national security concerns.",
