    "summary": "The UNRWA Funding Emergency Restoration Act of 2025 aims to restore U.S. funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The bill calls for the repeal of previous legislative actions that halted funding and directs the Secretary of State to resume funding, aligning with efforts to address humanitarian needs in Gaza. It supports UNRWA's services to Palestinian refugees and urges improved neutrality, transparency, and accountability measures, including implementation of recommendations from the Independent Review Group.",
