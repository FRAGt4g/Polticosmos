    "summary": "The Restoring American Freedom Act aims to prohibit the Department of State and its funded entities from censoring the free speech of US citizens. The bill amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to include monitoring and enforcement mechanisms against censorship. It defines \"censor,\" \"free speech,\" and \"advertising blacklist,\" and mandates notification of relevant congressional committees and the affected citizen if censorship activities are reported. The act also denies funds to entities employing advertising blacklists or distributing censorship tools lacking sufficient safeguards.",
