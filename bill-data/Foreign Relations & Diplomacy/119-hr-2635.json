    "summary": "The Uyghur Policy Act of 2025 addresses human rights concerns regarding Uyghurs and other minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of China. It calls for the PRC to allow access to the region for international observers, protect Uyghur cultural identity, and release political prisoners. The bill directs the Secretary of State to prioritize policies supporting Uyghurs, coordinate with international partners, and report on transnational repression. It also provides funds for public diplomacy and Uyghur language training, and directs the US to advocate for Uyghur rights at the United Nations.",
