    "summary": "The 'Informing a Nation with Free, Open, and Reliable Media Act of 2025' (INFORM Act) aims to increase access to independent information for Chinese citizens. It mandates the development of a strategy to counter China's internet censorship and propaganda. Key provisions include establishing a Global News Service to disseminate uncensored China-related news, increasing funding for circumvention tools, and creating an interagency task force to coordinate efforts. The bill emphasizes the lack of reciprocity in the information space and advocates for diplomatic engagement to address this issue.",
