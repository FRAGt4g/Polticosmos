It focuses on protecting orphaned, abandoned, and children in residential facilities from trafficking, which often involves exploitation, forced labor, and abuse. The bill seeks to explicitly recognize orphanage trafficking as a severe form of trafficking to enhance prosecution, victim protection, and condition foreign assistance.",
