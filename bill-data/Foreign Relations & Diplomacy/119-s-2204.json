    "summary": "This bill, the Protecting America\u2019s Diplomatic Workforce Act, aims to increase transparency, fairness, and protections for diplomatic personnel during reductions in force (RIFs). It limits the number of employees a covered agency can separate within a six-month period and mandates justifications, including impact assessments, for larger RIFs. The bill also amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to clarify RIF procedures, notice periods, and grievance processes, and modifies the Foreign Affairs Manual. It defines covered agencies and relevant congressional committees.",
