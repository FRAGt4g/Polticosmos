    "summary": "The 'No Dollars for Dictators Act of 2025' aims to prevent the U.S. from allocating Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to countries whose governments have committed genocide in the past decade or are state sponsors of terrorism. It amends the Special Drawing Rights Act, requiring Congressional authorization for such allocations to these nations, as determined by the Secretary of State based on specific legal definitions of terrorism support.",
