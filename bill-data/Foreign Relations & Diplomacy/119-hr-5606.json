    "summary": "This bill, the \"Return to Palestinian Entities Accountability and Counterterrorism Enforcement Act\" (Return to PEACE Act), codifies sanctions denying visas to Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) members and Palestinian Authority (PA) officials.  It allows the Secretary of State to waive these sanctions on a case-by-case basis, renewable for 180 days, contingent on the PLO/PA ceasing actions that undermine prior commitments related to UN resolutions, internationalizing the conflict, supporting terrorism, and providing benefits to terrorists. The sanctions will expire seven years after enactment.",
