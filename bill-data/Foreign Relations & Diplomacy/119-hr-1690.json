    "summary": "The 'Stopping Communist Regimes from Engaging in Edits Now Act' (SCREEN Act) aims to limit the use of U.S. government funds for film production if the content is subject to conditions or alterations for screening in China or at the request of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It mandates that U.S. companies disclose films submitted to the PRC or CCP for evaluation. The Secretary of State must provide an annual report to Congress listing relevant films and companies. The bill prohibits the provision of technical support or access to any asset controlled by the Federal Government for, or authorize the head of a Federal agency to enter into any contract relating to, the production or funding of a film by a United States company if the film is co-produced by a PRC entity subject to content conditions or if the content has been altered in response to a PRC/CCP request.",
