    "summary": "This bill, the \"STOP MADURO Act,\" increases the maximum reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros to $100,000,000. It authorizes the Secretary of State to pay this reward, specifying that the funds must come exclusively from the liquidation of assets withheld from Maduro, his officials, and co-conspirators under various U.S. sanctions and executive orders. The bill cites existing U.S. criminal charges against Maduro for narco-terrorism and drug trafficking as justification for the increased reward, aiming to hold him accountable.",
