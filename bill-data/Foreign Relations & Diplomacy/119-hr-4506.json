    "summary": "The Securing Global Telecommunications Act aims to promote secure telecommunications infrastructure worldwide. It mandates the Secretary of State to develop a strategy within 90 days, focusing on mobile networks, data centers, 6G technologies, and low-earth orbit satellites. The Act also calls for reports on malign influence at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), especially from China and Russia, and on multilateral coordination with allies to foster secure ICT infrastructure. The bill seeks to counter the influence of untrusted vendors, like those linked to the Chinese Communist Party, and promote American leadership in telecommunications.",
