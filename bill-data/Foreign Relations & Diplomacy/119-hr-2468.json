    "summary": "The 'No Sanctions Relief for Terrorists Act' aims to prevent the U.S. government from issuing licenses or waivers that would provide sanctions relief to Iranian individuals and entities involved in terrorism. It mandates that the President certify to specific congressional committees that these individuals and entities have ceased involvement in terrorism before any such relief is granted. This act focuses on individuals and entities listed as of January 20, 2021, and clarifies that it does not restrict existing general licenses from the Office of Foreign Asset Control.",
