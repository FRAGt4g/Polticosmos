    "summary": "The Maintaining Area Rights and Integrity Through International Maritime Enforcement Act (MARITIME Act) directs the Secretary of State to submit a report to Congress on U.S. efforts to promote policies regarding the impact of sea level rise on countries' statehood and maritime zones. The bill's policy statement asserts that sea level rise should not cause loss of statehood or diminish maritime zones, and encourages international cooperation. The report will detail initiatives to promote these policies, assess barriers, and list countries and organizations that have adopted similar policies.",
