    "summary": "This bill, the AUSSOM Funding Restriction Act of 2025, aims to restrict the use of U.S. assessed contributions to the United Nations for the African Union Support and Stabilisation Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM). It prohibits funding for AUSSOM-related activities under UN Security Council Resolution 2719, while allowing exceptions for UNSOS and voluntary U.S. contributions. The bill mandates annual assessments of the AU's compliance with Resolution 2719, and requires reports to Congress detailing funding, performance, and alternative funding mechanisms for AUSSOM. It also amends the United Nations Participation Act to include AU peace support operations in required consultations. ",
