    "summary": "The Silver Shield Operational End Use Monitoring Act of 2025 mandates the establishment of a program to monitor the operational use of U.S. defense articles and services sold, exported, or transferred under the Arms Export Control Act and Foreign Assistance Act. The program aims to determine if recipients use these items to inflict civilian harm or violate international laws. It requires a determination of ineligibility under certain conditions, incorporates data from existing programs, and utilizes diverse information sources for monitoring. The bill amends existing laws to include provisions against using U.S. defense articles & services to violate international humanitarian or human rights law. It also mandates reports to Congress on the program's implementation and resource needs.",
