    "summary": "The 'Leading Exports of Aerial Drones Act of 2025' (LEAD Act of 2025) amends the Arms Export Control Act to address export controls for unmanned aircraft systems (drones). It defines 'covered unmanned aircraft systems and items' and directs that they be treated like manned aircraft for export control purposes, particularly concerning the Missile Technology Control Regime. The bill mandates changes to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations to reflect these distinctions, including separate review criteria and guidelines. It aims to streamline drone exports and align them with existing manned aircraft regulations.",
