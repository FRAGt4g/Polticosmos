    "summary": "The 'WHO is Accountable Act' (H.R. 600) aims to restrict U.S. funding to the World Health Organization (WHO). It prohibits the use of federal funds for WHO membership or contributions until the Secretary of State certifies that the WHO meets specific conditions, including reforms to ensure humanitarian assistance isn't politicized, reduced Chinese influence, transparency in operations, and a halt to engagement on controversial social issues like gender identity and abortion. The bill also stipulates that WHO directives cannot legally bind U.S. citizens or states.",
