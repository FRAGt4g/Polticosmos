    "summary": "The Global Health, Empowerment and Rights Act (S. 280) aims to remove certain restrictions on foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) receiving US foreign assistance under Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. It prohibits denying assistance to these NGOs solely based on healthcare or medical services they provide using non-US government funds, provided these services are legal in the host country and would be legal in the US. It also removes restrictions on the use of non-US government funds for advocacy and lobbying, treating foreign NGOs the same as US NGOs in this regard. ",
