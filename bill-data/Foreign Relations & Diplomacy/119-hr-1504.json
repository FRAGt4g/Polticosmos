    "summary": "The China Trade Relations Act of 2025 aims to alter trade relations with China. It withdraws normal trade relations treatment, making future extensions subject to Chapter 1 of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974. The bill expands the criteria for ineligibility for normal trade relations, focusing on human rights issues, labor practices, intellectual property theft, and other concerns. It also outlines reporting requirements to Congress and allows the President to waive certain provisions under specific conditions.",
