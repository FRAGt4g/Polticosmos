    "summary": "The \"Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act\" (H.R. 243) is a bipartisan bill prohibiting U.S. recognition of any Georgian government led by Bidzina Ivanishvili or his proxies. Citing the regime's \"crimes against the Georgian people,\" the act opposes normalization of relations and mandates using sanctions to counter corruption and foreign influence from Russia, China, and Iran. The U.S. would recognize Georgia's pre-October 2024 president as the legitimate leader. This policy can be voided by the U.S. President if free and fair elections are certified in Georgia by the U.S. Helsinki Commission.",
