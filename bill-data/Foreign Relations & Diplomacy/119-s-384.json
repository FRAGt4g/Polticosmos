    "summary": "This bill, the \"Retiring the Egregious Confusion Over the Genuine Name of Israel\u2019s Zone of Influence by Necessitating Government-use of Judea and Samaria Act\" (RECOGNIZING Judea and Samaria Act), seeks to mandate that the U.S. government use the terms \"Judea and Samaria\" instead of \"West Bank\" in all official materials. It establishes a sense of Congress supporting this change, prohibits the use of \"West Bank,\" with some exceptions, and amends several existing laws to reflect the new terminology.",
