    "summary": "The China Exchange Rate Transparency Act of 2023 mandates that the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advocates for increased transparency from China regarding its exchange rate policies. This includes advocating for enhanced IMF surveillance, addressing deviations from other Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency issuers, and considering China's performance in the international monetary system during IMF governance reviews. This act will expire once China complies with IMF exchange rate obligations or seven years after enactment.",
