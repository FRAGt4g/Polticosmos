    "summary": "This bill, the Inspector General for Ukraine Act, establishes an Office of the Inspector General for Ukraine. The Inspector General, appointed by the President with Senate consent, will oversee audits and investigations related to the use of funds for military and non-military support of Ukraine. The bill outlines the Inspector General's duties, powers, reporting requirements (including quarterly reports to Congressional committees), and provides for staff, resources, and contracting authority. It also authorizes $70 million in appropriations for this office, offset by a reduction in funds for the Economic Support Fund for Ukraine. The office will terminate after five years.",
