    "summary": "The Stop Russian Market Manipulation Act aims to prohibit the importation of specific minerals (platinum, nickel, and copper) from the Russian Federation and Russian entities. This prohibition takes effect 90 days after the bill's enactment and would terminate one year after the President certifies to Congress that Russia has ended hostilities against Ukraine. The prohibition will resume if hostilities resume within three years of certification. The President cannot waive this prohibition. The bill defines \"Russian entity\" as an entity organized under or subject to the laws of the Russian Federation.",
