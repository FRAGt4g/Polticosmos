    "summary": "This bill, HR 2059, aims to block the issuance of licenses for exporting certain defense articles to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This prohibition is enacted because the President must certify to relevant congressional committees that the UAE is not supporting the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan. The bill defines \"covered defense articles\" by referencing categories from the U.S. Munitions List.",
