    "summary": "The bill, the Prioritizing Offensive Agricultural Disputes and Enforcement Act (Ag Disputes Act), aims to eliminate barriers to U.S. agricultural exports. It mandates the establishment of a joint task force to identify trade barriers vulnerable to dispute settlement, develop enforcement strategies, and identify co-complainants. The bill focuses heavily on addressing India's agricultural subsidies, which are deemed to be in violation of WTO commitments, and includes a plan for consultations and potential dispute settlement under the WTO.",
