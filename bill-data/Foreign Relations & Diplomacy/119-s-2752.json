    "summary": "This bill, the U.S.-South Africa Bilateral Relations Review Act, mandates a comprehensive review of the relationship between the United States and South Africa. It highlights concerns regarding South Africa's alignment with countries like Russia and China, its stance on Israel, and domestic issues such as corruption. The bill requires a report to Congress, including a certification on whether South Africa's actions undermine U.S. interests and a classified report on potential sanctionable individuals. It also threatens to end South Africa's eligibility for certain trade preference programs if the review identifies problematic activities.",
