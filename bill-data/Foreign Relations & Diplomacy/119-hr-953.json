It mandates the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate the impact of existing regional trade agreements on U.S. competitiveness. It also establishes an independent commission to develop a comprehensive trade strategy for the Indo-Pacific, focusing on countering China's influence, promoting U.S. interests, and bolstering national security and supply chain resilience. The commission will conduct hearings, solicit public comment, consult with Congress, and submit a final report within 18 months of the bill's enactment.",
