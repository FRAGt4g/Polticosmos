    "summary": "The \"Restoring Trade Fairness Act\" aims to suspend normal trade relations with China and increase tariffs on goods from the People's Republic of China. The bill cites concerns about China's trade practices, intellectual property theft, and non-compliance with trade agreements. It outlines a process for adjusting duty rates, establishing tariff-rate quotas for certain goods, and provides authority for further modifying tariffs and imposing quotas or prohibitions. It also seeks to address potential retaliatory actions by China and proposes allocating duty revenue to compensate U.S. producers and fund defense initiatives.",
