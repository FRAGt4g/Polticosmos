    "summary": "This bill, the \"No WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty Without Senate Approval Act,\" mandates that any international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response reached by the World Health Assembly (WHA) and the International Negotiating Body (INB) be subject to Senate ratification. The bill cites concerns regarding the WHO's independence and the breadth of the INB's mandate. It expresses the sense of Congress that such agreements should be treated as treaties requiring a two-thirds Senate approval and supports Taiwan's participation in the WHO. The bill also references the United States\u2019 previous withdrawal and attempts to withdraw from the WHO.",
