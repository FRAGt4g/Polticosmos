    "summary": "This bill, the \"Fully Funding our National Security Priorities Act,\" mandates that the Secretary of State submit a report to Congress detailing the Department of State's unfunded priorities. This report, due within 10 days of the President's budget submission, will outline each unfunded priority, including its objectives, required funding, and budget information. The report must also prioritize these unfunded needs. The bill defines \"unfunded priority\" as a program or activity deemed necessary for foreign policy or national security that was not included in the President's budget but would have been if funds were available.",
