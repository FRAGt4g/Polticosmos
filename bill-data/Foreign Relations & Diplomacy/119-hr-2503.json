    "summary": "The 'Undersea Cable Control Act' aims to restrict foreign adversaries' access to goods and technologies that support undersea cables. It mandates the President, in coordination with relevant agencies, to create a strategy identifying critical items, export controls, and potential collaboration with allies. The bill requires reports to Congress, seeks bilateral/multilateral agreements with allies, and directs the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate items for export controls. It defines 'foreign adversary' and 'item,' and ensures public access to reports while facilitating a strategy for more secure global communications networks.",
