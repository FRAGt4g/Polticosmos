    "summary": "This bill, the \"Aligning SEC Regulations for the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association Act,\" aims to exempt securities issued by the International Development Association (IDA), a part of the World Bank, from certain U.S. securities laws. It amends existing legislation to grant these securities the same exemption as those of other multilateral development banks.  The bill also requires the IDA to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and grants the SEC the authority to suspend the exemption under specific conditions.  The exemption takes effect 30 days after enactment, unless the Secretary of the Treasury reports that the IDA is aiding a country that supports international terrorism.",
