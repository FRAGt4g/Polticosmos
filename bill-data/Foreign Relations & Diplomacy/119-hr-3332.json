    "summary": "The Pacific Partnership Act aims to strengthen U.S. engagement with the Pacific Islands region. It mandates the President to create a 'Strategy for Pacific Partnership' outlining goals, threat assessments (natural disasters, economic coercion, etc.), resource plans, and cooperation mechanisms. The bill also addresses diplomatic immunities for the Pacific Islands Forum, promotes collaboration with allies (Australia, Japan, etc.), and requires updates to existing reports on transnational crime. Finally, it defines terms and establishes reporting requirements.",
