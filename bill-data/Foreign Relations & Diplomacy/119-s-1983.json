    "summary": "This bill, the \"No WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty Without Senate Approval Act,\" mandates that any international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response reached by the World Health Assembly (WHO) be subject to Senate ratification. It cites concerns about the WHO's independence, particularly regarding China, and expresses the Senate's preference for such agreements to be considered treaties requiring a two-thirds vote for approval. The bill also highlights existing distrust in the WHO and emphasizes that agreements lacking Senate approval should not be implemented by the U.S.",
