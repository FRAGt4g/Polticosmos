    "summary": "This bill, \"Designating the Russian Federation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism Act,\" calls for the Secretary of State to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism if the Ukrainian children kidnapped during the invasion of Ukraine have not been reunited with their families and if their reintegration into Ukrainian society is not underway. The Secretary can rescind this designation if certain conditions are met, including Russia ceasing support for international terrorism and repatriating the children. The bill cites several findings regarding Russia's actions in Ukraine and references existing U.S. laws related to state sponsors of terrorism and outlines conditions for rescinding the designation.",
