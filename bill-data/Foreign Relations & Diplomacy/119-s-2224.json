    "summary": "The Taiwan International Solidarity Act amends the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019. It clarifies that UN Resolution 2758 did not address Taiwan's representation and that the US opposes any change to Taiwan's status without its consent. The bill mandates the US to advocate within international organizations against China's attempts to misrepresent its One China position regarding Taiwan. It also encourages US allies to oppose China's efforts to undermine Taiwan's international relationships and requires a report on China's related activities.",
