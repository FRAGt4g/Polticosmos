    "summary": "The Uyghur Human Rights Protection Act (H.R. 2349) designates residents of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) as Priority 2 refugees with special humanitarian concern, facilitating their resettlement in the United States. The bill addresses the repression of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in XUAR by the Chinese government, citing human rights violations and detailing criteria for refugee status. It includes provisions for processing, application facilitation, reporting requirements, and encourages international cooperation. The bill also includes a waiver of immigrant status presumption for those seeking asylum and asylum determinations under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The bill will cease to have effect 10 years after its enactment.",
