    "summary": "The Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with other federal agencies, to conduct a review of the global competitiveness of the U.S. in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly from 'trusted countries'. The review will focus on the economic impact of FDI, global investment trends, existing federal policies, and challenges posed by state-owned enterprises, especially those related to the Chinese Communist Party. It mandates a report to Congress with recommendations to enhance U.S. competitiveness in attracting FDI while safeguarding security and labor protections.",
