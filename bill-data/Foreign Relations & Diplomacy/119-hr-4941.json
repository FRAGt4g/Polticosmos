    "summary": "The 'Limiting Extremist Travel to the United Nations Act' directs the Secretary of State to restrict travel for specific officials attending UN meetings in New York City. Officials from Iran, individuals with ties to Foreign Terrorist Organizations, and those from UN organizations the US isn't a member of face limitations. These limitations include restricted travel routes and, for certain officials, a limited timeframe around the UN General Assembly. Exceptions are made for accessibility or security concerns. The bill doesn't apply to US citizens or legal residents.",
