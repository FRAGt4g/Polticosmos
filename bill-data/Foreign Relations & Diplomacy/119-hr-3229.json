    "summary": "The Foreign Agents Transparency Act (HR 3229) amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. The bill clarifies the continuing obligation of individuals to register as foreign agents, even after their activities on behalf of foreign principals have ceased. It allows the Attorney General to seek compliance orders even after FARA activities have ended and mandates annual reports detailing enforcement actions taken against individuals who were foreign agents in the past five years. This includes information on the rationale and status of each action. The bill primarily aims to increase transparency around foreign influence.",
