    "summary": "The Taiwan Allies Fund Act aims to support Taiwan's international space. It authorizes $40 million annually for fiscal years 2026-2028 to be allocated to countries that maintain, or have strengthened, unofficial relations with Taiwan and have faced coercion from China. Funds will be used for health initiatives, civil society capacity building, supply chain diversification, and promoting Taiwan's participation in international forums. The Secretary of State, in collaboration with relevant agencies, will implement the program, reporting to Congress annually on its activities and effectiveness. Coordination and cost-sharing with Taiwan are also emphasized.",
