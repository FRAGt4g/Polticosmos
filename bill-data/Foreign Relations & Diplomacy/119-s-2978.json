    "summary": "This bill, \"Designating the Russian Federation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism Act,\" aims to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. It focuses on Russia's actions in Ukraine, particularly the kidnapping, deportation, and displacement of Ukrainian children. The bill mandates the Secretary of State to report to Congress on the reunification of these children with their families and their reintegration into Ukrainian society. If these conditions aren't met within 60 days, the Secretary of State is required to make the designation. The bill also outlines conditions under which the designation could be rescinded.",
