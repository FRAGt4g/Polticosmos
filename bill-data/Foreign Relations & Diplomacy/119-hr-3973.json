    "summary": "The Ukraine War Risk Insurance Act aims to provide temporary war risk insurance for commercial vessels transporting goods to and from Ukraine. It enables eligible vessels to receive insurance under current U.S. law, establishes an 'Insurance for Ukraine Initiative' within the Department of State to promote economic recovery and coordinate with international partners, and directs the Secretary of State to provide diplomatic support to countries involved in war risk insurance for Ukraine. The bill also instructs the U.S. representative to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization to advocate for a multilateral insurance mechanism for Ukrainian grain shipments.",
