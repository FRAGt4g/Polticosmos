    "summary": "The 'Ending China's Unfair Advantage Act of 2025' aims to restrict US funding for the Montreal Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The bill mandates that no federal funds be used for these initiatives until the President certifies to Congress that China is no longer considered a developing country, for the Montreal Protocol, or included in Annex I of the Convention for climate change funding. This reflects concerns over China's role and its obligations regarding environmental treaties and climate commitments.",
