    "summary": "The Freedom First Lend Lease Act (H.R. 1158) grants the President enhanced authority to lend or lease defense articles to the Ukrainian government and Eastern European countries impacted by Russia's invasion. This aims to bolster their defense capabilities and protect civilian populations.  The bill specifies exclusions to existing laws regarding loan/lease agreements, mandates expedited procedures for article delivery, and defines 'defense article.' The President can only delegate this authority to a Senate-confirmed official. It covers fiscal years 2026 and 2027.",
