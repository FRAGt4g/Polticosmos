    "summary": "The China Technology Transfer Control Act of 2025 aims to restrict the export and transfer of critical US technology and intellectual property to the People's Republic of China. The bill defines \"covered national interest technology\" and intellectual property that could harm US national security or contribute to human rights violations. It mandates presidential control over these exports, requires reports from the Secretary of State and Commerce, and authorizes sanctions against those who violate the restrictions. Furthermore, it directs the US Trade Representative to create a list of Chinese products receiving government support or used for human rights abuses.",
