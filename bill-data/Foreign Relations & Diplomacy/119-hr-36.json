    "summary": "The 'MEGOBARI Act' (H.R. 36) aims to counter Russian, Chinese, and Iranian influence in Georgia by addressing the country's recent democratic backsliding. It establishes a dual-track policy, imposing sanctions like asset freezes and visa bans on Georgian officials who undermine democracy or block the nation's Euro-Atlantic integration. Conversely, it offers enhanced U.S. aid and military cooperation if Georgia demonstrates significant and sustained progress in democratic reforms. The bill also requires reports on foreign intelligence assets in Georgia and a new U.S. strategy for bilateral relations. The act includes a five-year sunset provision.",
