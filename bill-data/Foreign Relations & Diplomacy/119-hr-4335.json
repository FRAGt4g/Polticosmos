    "summary": "The Abraham Accords Defense Against Terror Act aims to enhance security assistance to countries in the Middle East and North Africa that have normalized relations with Israel and are engaged in regional security cooperation against threats from Iran and its aligned entities. The bill allows for expedited approval of defense articles and services to these countries, requiring the President to submit certifications to Congress at least 15 days before approval. It also mandates the Secretary of State to submit a strategy report every 60 days on the implementation of the Act, including the security threats from Iran, metrics for evaluating cooperation, and recommendations for improving the process for authorizing defense transfers.",
