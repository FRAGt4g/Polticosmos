    "summary": "The 'Free Iraq from Iran Act' addresses Iran's influence in Iraq. It mandates the creation of an interagency strategy, involving the Department of State, Treasury, and US Agency for Global Media, to support Iraq's liberation from Iran.  The bill outlines efforts to dismantle Iran-backed militias (e.g., PMF), condition U.S. security assistance, and support Iraqi civil society. It also calls for the designation of specific groups as foreign terrorist organizations, prohibits U.S. funding for the militias and security assistance to the Iraqi government unless certain criteria are met, imposes sanctions, and prohibits the import of Iranian liquefied natural gas by Iraq.",
