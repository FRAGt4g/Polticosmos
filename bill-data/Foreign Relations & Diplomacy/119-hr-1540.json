    "summary": "The Falun Gong Protection Act aims to impose sanctions on individuals involved in forced organ harvesting in China. It mandates the President to create and update a list of foreign persons engaged in or facilitating such practices, leading to asset blocking and visa/entry denials. The bill also requires a report from the Secretary of State on China's organ transplant policies and practices, including the role of Falun Gong persecution. Sanctions have exemptions for humanitarian aid and national security, with a sunset clause after five years. Imports are also exempt from sanctions. ",
