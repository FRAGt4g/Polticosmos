    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 298, seeks to strengthen the U.S. security partnership with the Republic of Cyprus by removing existing legal barriers to military sales and assistance. It proposes amending both the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2020 and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The changes would eliminate specific limitations and requirements that currently restrict the transfer of U.S. defense articles and the provision of security assistance to Cyprus. In effect, this legislation aims to fully lift the U.S. arms embargo on the country, enabling a closer defense relationship.",
