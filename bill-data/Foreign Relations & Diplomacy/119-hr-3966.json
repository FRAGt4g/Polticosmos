    "summary": "The Think Tank and Nonprofit Foreign Influence Disclosure Act aims to increase transparency regarding foreign influence on U.S. nonprofit organizations, particularly think tanks and cultural organizations. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require public reporting of contributions exceeding $10,000 from foreign governments, political parties, and entities. This information will be made publicly available in a searchable database, focusing on contributions from specific entities like the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and their related entities, citing concerns about national security risks and influence operations.
