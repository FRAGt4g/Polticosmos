    "summary": "The United Nations Voting Accountability Act of 2025 aims to prevent U.S. assistance to foreign countries that vote against the United States' position in the United Nations.  It defines \"oppose the position of the United States\" based on voting records in the UN General Assembly and Security Council.  The Secretary of State can provide exemptions if there is a fundamental government change. It specifies what constitutes \"United States assistance\" and sets an effective date tied to a report to Congress.",
