    "summary": "This bill, \"Honduras Obstinately Neglects Defense and Risks Alienating Security Act\" (HONDURAS Act), aims to restrict U.S. financial assistance to Honduras. It is triggered by the Honduran government's refusal to host U.S. personnel at Soto Cano Air Base. The President is authorized to suspend all aid, including that related to a 1954 military assistance agreement between the U.S. and Honduras, once U.S. personnel are redeployed. The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on January 16, 2025.",
