    "summary": "The 'Stopping Propaganda Indoctrination Nationally Act' (SPIN Act) aims to amend the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948. It prohibits the dissemination of certain information within the United States, its territories, and possessions. While this information will not be shared with the public, it will be made available to specific groups such as US press representatives, research scholars, and Members of Congress. The bill's intent is to create a more strict barrier between the public and potentially biased information.",
