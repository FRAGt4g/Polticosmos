    "summary": "The Taiwan Representative Office Act directs the Secretary of State to negotiate with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office to rename its office in the U.S. as the Taiwan Representative Office. The bill asserts the U.S. policy of providing Taiwan with de facto diplomatic treatment and clarifies that renaming the office does not restore diplomatic relations or alter the U.S. position on Taiwan's international status. It also specifies that all U.S. government references to the office will be updated if the renaming occurs.",
