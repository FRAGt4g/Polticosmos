    "summary": "The \"Old Glory Only Act\" (H.R. 465) is a bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that seeks to regulate the flags flown at U.S. diplomatic and consular posts. The legislation mandates that the Secretary of State must ensure that no flag other than the official United States flag is displayed over these facilities. This proposed law would restrict the display of all other flags, such as those representing specific causes or other nations, at American embassies and consulates worldwide. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for consideration.",
