    "summary": "The Strategic Ports Reporting Act mandates the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State to monitor China's efforts to acquire or control strategic foreign ports.  It requires mapping of important ports, identifies PRC involvement, and mandates a study on the implications of PRC control, including vulnerabilities and potential harm to U.S. interests. The bill suggests a strategy to secure trusted investment, protect ports, and ensure open access to them, and requires a report to Congress with detailed findings and recommendations.",
