    "summary": "The Restoring Trade Fairness Act proposes suspending normal trade relations with China and increasing duties on articles imported from the country. The bill outlines findings about China's trade practices, its World Trade Organization compliance, and the impact on the U.S. economy. It mandates a revision of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, sets new duty rates, and includes provisions for inflation adjustments, phase-in of duty increases, and potential further modifications. Additionally, the bill establishes a trust fund to compensate U.S. producers for losses due to Chinese retaliation.",
