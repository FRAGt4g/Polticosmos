    "summary": "The 'Prevent Regulatory Overreach from Turning Essential Companies into Targets Act of 2025' (PROTECT USA Act) prohibits U.S. entities deemed integral to national interests from complying with foreign sustainability due diligence regulations, particularly the EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. The bill defines these entities, outlines exceptions, and establishes a process for hardship relief. It prohibits adverse actions against covered entities for non-compliance and prevents recognition of foreign court judgments related to these regulations in U.S. courts. Enforcement mechanisms, including Presidential action and a private right of action, are included, along with penalties.",
