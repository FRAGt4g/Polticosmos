    "summary": "The \"Panama Canal Repurchase Act of 2025\" (H.R. 283) authorizes the U.S. President, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, to enter negotiations with the Republic of Panama to reacquire the Panama Canal. This legislative proposal, introduced by Representative Johnson of South Dakota and several co-sponsors, does not mandate the repurchase but provides the executive branch with the authority to pursue it. It also requires the President to submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the law's enactment, detailing the progress of the negotiations, any potential challenges, and the anticipated outcomes.",
