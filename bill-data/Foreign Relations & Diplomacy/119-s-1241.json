    "summary": "The 'Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025' proposes sanctions against Russia if the Russian government refuses to negotiate peace with Ukraine, violates any peace agreement, or initiates another military invasion. The bill outlines various sanctions including asset freezes, visa restrictions, prohibitions on financial transactions, trade restrictions (including energy exports, uranium imports, and sovereign debt purchases), and increased duties on imports from Russia and countries purchasing Russian-origin goods. It also mandates the imposition of CAATSA sanctions and provides for termination and reimposition of these measures based on Russia's actions.",
