    "summary": "The Protect U.S. National Security Act aims to prevent the elimination of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) by prohibiting the use of federal funds for this purpose. The bill emphasizes that any reform or reorganization of USAID should align with existing laws, maintain U.S. influence abroad, and prevent adversaries from gaining ground. It requires the Secretary of State to certify compliance with the prohibition annually to relevant Congressional committees.",
