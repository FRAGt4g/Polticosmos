    "summary": "The 'No War Against Iran Act' aims to prevent the use of U.S. funds for military force against Iran without explicit Congressional approval. The bill emphasizes Congress's sole power to declare war and establishes strict conditions for any military action, requiring either a declaration of war or a specific statutory authorization that adheres to the War Powers Resolution. It clarifies that existing authorizations do not apply to Iran and outlines exceptions for self-defense while reaffirming the President's obligations under the War Powers Resolution.",
