    "summary": "The Pacific Partnership Act aims to strengthen U.S. engagement with the Pacific Islands region. It mandates the President to develop a comprehensive strategy by 2026 and 2030, outlining goals, assessing threats (natural disasters, non-U.S. military presence, etc.), and detailing resource plans. The bill emphasizes collaboration with regional partners like the Pacific Islands Forum, as well as allies such as Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. It calls for extending diplomatic immunities to the Pacific Islands Forum and coordinating assistance programs with regional allies. The bill also requires annual updates to existing reports to include regional discussions on transnational crime and amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 regarding strategy documents for the Indo-Pacific region.",
