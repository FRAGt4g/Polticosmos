    "summary": "The United States Legal Gold and Mining Partnership Act aims to combat illicit gold mining in the Western Hemisphere. It mandates the Secretary of State, in coordination with relevant federal agencies, to develop a multi-year strategy to address the environmental and social impacts of illegal gold mining. The strategy focuses on disrupting links between illicit actors and artisanal mining, deterring mining in protected areas, countering financing of illegal activities, building the capacity of foreign law enforcement, and fostering international cooperation to promote responsible gold value chains. The bill also calls for investigation of illicit gold trade, specifically in Venezuela, and the use of United States punitive measures.",
