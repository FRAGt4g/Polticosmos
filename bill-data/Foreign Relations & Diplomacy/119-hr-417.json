    "summary": "This bill, the 'End U.N. Censorship Act,' prohibits the use of any U.S. federal funds to support the United Nations' iVerify tool or any similar platform that labels speech as 'mal-, mis-, or dis-information.' The prohibition extends to voluntary contributions to the U.N. or any other international organization for such purposes. The legislation mandates that any funds withheld under this act are to be permanently rescinded and deposited into the U.S. Treasury, and will not be considered arrears owed to the United Nations. It aims to prevent U.S. funds from supporting international speech-labeling initiatives.",
