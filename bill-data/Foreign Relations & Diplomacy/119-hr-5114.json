    "summary": "This bill, the \"No Foreign Fundraising at United States Embassies Act,\" prohibits the use of U.S. embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic posts for fundraising events on behalf of foreign political parties or candidates. It aims to maintain political neutrality in foreign elections and prevent the use of diplomatic resources to provide financial or electoral advantages. The bill amends existing legislation to restrict funding for such events and requires the Secretary of State to update regulations to reflect these prohibitions.",
