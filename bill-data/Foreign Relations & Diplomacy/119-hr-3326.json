    "summary": "The Persian Gulf Act, introduced in the House of Representatives, aims to prohibit the use of federal funds to rename the Persian Gulf. The bill explicitly states that any renaming requires express Congressional authorization and bars the use of federal funds for this purpose. It ensures that official U.S. documents maintain the name 'Persian Gulf' unless explicitly changed by Congress.",
