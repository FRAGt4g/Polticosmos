    "summary": "The Saving Lives and Taxpayer Dollars Act (H.R. 4516) mandates the Secretary of State to ensure that commodities procured for foreign assistance, such as food, medicine, and vaccines, are made available to intended beneficiaries before they expire. The bill prohibits the destruction of these commodities unless all efforts to sell, donate, or otherwise distribute them have been exhausted. It also requires an annual report to Congress detailing any expired, spoiled, or destroyed commodities, including reasons and costs. The goal is to prevent waste and maximize the impact of foreign aid.",
