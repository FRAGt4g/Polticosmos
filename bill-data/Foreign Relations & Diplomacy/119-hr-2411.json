    "summary": "This bill, the UNRWA Funding Emergency Restoration Act of 2025, aims to restore funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). It repeals previous legislation that restricted UNRWA funding and mandates the Secretary of State to resume funding provision. The bill emphasizes the importance of UNRWA's humanitarian work in Gaza and urges the President to restore funding and rescind a related Executive Order. It also requires the Secretary of State to report on UNRWA's implementation of external review recommendations.",
