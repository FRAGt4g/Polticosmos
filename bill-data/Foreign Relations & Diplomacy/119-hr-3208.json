    "summary": "The 'No Official Palestine Entry Act of 2025' aims to limit U.S. funding to the United Nations and related organizations that grant the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) any status, rights, or privileges beyond observer status. The bill amends existing legislation (Foreign Relations Authorization Acts of 1990/91 and 1994/95) to reflect this restriction, and specifically excludes Taiwan from the purview of this act.",
