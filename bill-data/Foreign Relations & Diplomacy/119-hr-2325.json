    "summary": "This bill, the Central African Exploitation and Manipulation of American Companies Act (CEMAC Act), aims to withhold U.S. support for IMF actions related to Central African Economic Monetary Community (CEMAC) member states until the IMF clarifies that site rehabilitation funds provided by international oil companies (IOCs) to the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) are ineligible for inclusion in gross foreign exchange reserves. It highlights concerns about a BEAC foreign exchange regulation, its potential negative impact on oil and gas investment, and the IMF's role in the matter, specifically its responsibility to clarify eligible assets for foreign exchange reserves. The bill directs specific actions for the Secretary of the Treasury, including a determination and reporting to relevant congressional committees.",
