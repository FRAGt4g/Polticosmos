    "summary": "This bill directs the Secretary of State to annually publish a tiered ranking of all foreign countries based on their governmental corruption levels and efforts to combat it. Countries are ranked as Tier 1 (compliant), Tier 2 (making efforts), or Tier 3 (making minimal or no effort). It establishes minimum anti-corruption standards for this evaluation. For Tier 3 countries, the bill requires an evaluation of whether to impose sanctions on corrupt foreign persons under the Global Magnitsky Act. It also requires the designation of anti-corruption points of contact in U.S. embassies in Tier 2 and Tier 3 countries.",
