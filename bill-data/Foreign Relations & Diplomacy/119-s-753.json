    "summary": "The 'Strengthening Exports Against China Act' amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945. It aims to exclude certain financing from the calculation of the Bank's default rate, specifically financing that supports competition with entities on the Commerce Department\u2019s Entity List or those sanctioned by the Treasury Department. Additionally, it exempts financing provided under the Program on China and Transformational Exports. The bill's main goal is to bolster US exports and counter Chinese economic influence.",
