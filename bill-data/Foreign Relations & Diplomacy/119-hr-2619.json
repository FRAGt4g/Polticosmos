The bill mandates reports and certifications regarding Iranian funds released to Qatar, reviews and reports on sanctions under the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery Act, limits travel of Iranian diplomats, and requires reports on blocked Iranian assets and international efforts to seize Iranian assets. It also addresses the validity of U.S. passports for travel to Iran and calls for a strategy to deter hostage-taking.",
