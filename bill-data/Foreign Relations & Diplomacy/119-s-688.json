    "summary": "The 'Fighting Foreign Illegal Seafood Harvests Act of 2025' (FISH Act) aims to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing globally. It establishes an IUU vessel list, restricting access to U.S. ports, services, and prohibiting the import of seafood from listed vessels. The bill authorizes sanctions, encourages international cooperation, and mandates reports on IUU fishing, including its impact on the U.S. economy, and the relationship between the Russian and Chinese fishing industries. It also outlines enforcement measures, data collection and sharing strategies, and invests in programs to support sustainable fisheries management and combat forced labor in fisheries.",
