    "summary": "The 'Defending American Property Abroad Act of 2025' addresses the nationalization or expropriation of US-owned assets by foreign governments.  It mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation, to identify properties in covered foreign trade partners (Western Hemisphere countries with free trade agreements) where US assets have been seized.  The President is then required to prohibit vessels that used these properties from importing goods, releasing goods/passengers, or undertaking servicing in the US. The bill also broadens the definition of unreasonable or discriminatory trade practices under the Trade Act of 1974 to include expropriation of US assets.",
