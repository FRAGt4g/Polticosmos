    "summary": "The Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act of 2025 aims to combat international trafficking in persons for organ removal. It defines forced organ harvesting and related terms, authorizes passport denial/revocation for offenders, mandates reports on the issue in foreign countries, and imposes sanctions on individuals or entities involved in such activities, including property blocking and visa restrictions. The bill seeks to promote voluntary organ donation systems and hold accountable those implicated in forced organ harvesting, including members of the Chinese Communist Party.",
