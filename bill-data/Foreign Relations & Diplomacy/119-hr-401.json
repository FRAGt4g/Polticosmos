    "summary": "H.R. 401, titled the \"No Taxpayer Funding for the World Health Organization Act,\" proposes to completely halt all United States financial support to the World Health Organization (WHO). Introduced by Representative Roy and several cosponsors, the bill explicitly prohibits both assessed contributions (required membership dues) and any voluntary contributions. This comprehensive funding ban would become effective immediately upon the bill's enactment and would supersede any other existing laws that might otherwise authorize payments to the WHO. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for consideration.",
