    "summary": "This bill, the \"Protecting Higher Education from the Chinese Communist Party Act of 2025,\" aims to restrict the visas of Chinese Communist Party members and their family members (F and J visas). It would prevent these individuals from gaining student or exchange visitor status in the United States. Exemptions are provided for individuals necessary for the U.S. to uphold its agreements with the United Nations.  The President can waive these restrictions if it's deemed in the national security interest, and a justification is provided to relevant congressional committees.",
