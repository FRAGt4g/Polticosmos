    "summary": "This bill, known as the Preventing the Escalation of Armed Conflict in Europe Act of 2025, aims to utilize financial sanctions to pressure Russia to end its conflict with Ukraine. It directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prohibit or restrict foreign financial institutions from opening or maintaining accounts in the U.S. if they support entities related to the Russian Federation via various Executive Orders and legislation. The bill also requires a report on specific Russian entities to determine if they fall under the sanction criteria, allows for presidential waivers under certain conditions, and sets a termination date linked to Russia's cessation of destabilizing activities in Ukraine or a 5-year limit.",
