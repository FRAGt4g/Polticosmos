    "summary": "The Fighting Foreign Illegal Seafood Harvests Act of 2025 aims to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing globally. It mandates the creation of an IUU vessel list, restricts access to U.S. ports and trade for listed vessels, and authorizes sanctions against those involved in IUU fishing or forced labor in the fishing industry. The bill also encourages international cooperation, increased Coast Guard enforcement, data sharing, and investment in sustainable fisheries management. It also requires several reports and studies on topics like the impact of new technology, collusion between Russian and Chinese fishing industries.",
