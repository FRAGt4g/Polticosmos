    "summary": "The 'Preventing Armed Groups from Engaging in Radicalism' or 'PAGER' Act aims to restrict U.S. federal funds to the Lebanese Armed Forces and the United Nations Development Programme. It mandates the Secretary of State to certify, among other things, that the Lebanese government is no longer influenced by Hezbollah, that Hezbollah has been expelled from strongholds, and that there is no collaboration between the Lebanese Armed Forces and Hezbollah. The bill also designates Suhil Bahij Gharab as a global terrorist and requires reports on Iranian and Hezbollah influence in Lebanon.",
