    "summary": "This bill, the Axing Nonmarket Tariff Evasion Act (ANTE Act), aims to amend the Trade Act of 1974. It authorizes the U.S. Trade Representative to impose remedial measures on entities that evade or attempt to evade duties imposed on products from nonmarket economy countries. This includes the power to investigate, and potentially impose duties on goods produced in third countries by entities controlled by nonmarket economy countries, effectively combating tariff evasion. The bill defines key terms, outlines inquiry processes, and specifies the duration of imposed measures.",
