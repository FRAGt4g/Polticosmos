    "summary": "This bill, the \"No Tax Dollars for Terrorists Act,\" directs the Secretary of State to develop and implement a strategy to stop foreign countries and NGOs from financially supporting the Taliban, especially those receiving U.S. aid. It mandates several reports to Congress that must identify entities supporting the Taliban, detail U.S. direct cash assistance programs in Afghanistan, and assess the status and security of the \"Afghan Fund.\" The core purpose is to establish oversight and ensure U.S. taxpayer money does not directly or indirectly benefit the Taliban terrorist organization.",
