    "summary": "The Sovereign Enforcement Integrity Act of 2025 prohibits state and local law enforcement from arresting or detaining foreign nationals within the U.S. based solely on warrants or requests from the International Criminal Court (ICC). The bill aims to protect U.S. foreign policy interests and constitutional authority over foreign relations. It contains exceptions for cases authorized by Congress or the President under specific national security circumstances and preempts any state or local laws contradicting it. The Act also emphasizes that the U.S. is not a party to the Rome Statute establishing the ICC and finds that law enforcement activities implicating international law enforcement obligations must be governed by uniform national standards.",
