    "summary": "This bill, the \"Restoring Confidence in the World Anti-Doping Agency Act of 2025,\" aims to amend the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006. The bill focuses on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), mandating the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to ensure WADA has a credible governance model with fair US representation. It also requires the ONDCP to ensure WADA implements governance reforms, ensures independent athlete involvement, and counters doping. The ONDCP, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, will make determinations regarding WADA\u2019s governance and may withhold dues if the agency fails to meet the bill\u2019s requirements. A spending plan for WADA funds must be submitted to relevant congressional committees.",
