    "summary": "The End the Cyprus Embargo Act aims to lift the U.S. embargo on arms exports to the Republic of Cyprus. The bill asserts that allowing such exports would benefit U.S. security interests in Europe and recognizes Cyprus's compliance with previous agreements. It outlines exceptions for human rights concerns and allows for presidential waivers. The bill also includes provisions for potential termination of the exclusion if Cyprus fails to cooperate with the U.S. on anti-money laundering and denies access to Russian military vessels.",
