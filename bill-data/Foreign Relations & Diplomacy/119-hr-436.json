    "summary": "This bipartisan bill, H.R. 436, seeks to prevent the Russian Federation from participating in the Group of Seven (G7). It establishes a U.S. policy to exclude Russia from the group and explicitly prohibits the use of any federal funds to support or facilitate Russia's involvement in G7 proceedings. Furthermore, the bill blocks federal funding for any action that would reconstitute the former Group of Eight (G8) with Russia as a member, solidifying a stance against Russia's inclusion in the forum of leading industrial nations.",
