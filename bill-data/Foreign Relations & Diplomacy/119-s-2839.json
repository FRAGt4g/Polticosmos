    "summary": "The Restoring American Mineral Security Act of 2025 aims to establish a Critical Minerals Security Alliance to secure a reliable supply chain of critical minerals for the U.S. and its allies. It authorizes the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate with other countries to join the alliance, setting criteria for membership including increased tariffs on critical minerals from countries of concern and cooperation on trade remedies. The bill also establishes a trust fund to support U.S. mining and processing projects. The goal is to reduce U.S. reliance on China and promote a domestic critical minerals industry.",
