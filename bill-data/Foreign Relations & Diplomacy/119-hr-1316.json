    "summary": "This bill, the \"Maintaining American Superiority by Improving Export Control Transparency Act,\" aims to increase transparency regarding export licenses. It mandates the Secretary to submit annual reports to relevant congressional committees detailing license applications, enforcement actions, and authorization requests for items controlled for export. These reports will include details such as the entity submitting the application, item descriptions, end-user information, and decision outcomes. While most of the individual data within the reports would be confidential, aggregate statistics will be made public. The bill defines \"covered entities\" and specifies which congressional committees will receive the report.",
