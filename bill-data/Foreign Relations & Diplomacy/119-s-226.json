    "summary": "The No Tax Dollars for Terrorists Act aims to prevent financial and material support to the Taliban by foreign countries and NGOs. It mandates the Secretary of State to submit reports identifying those providing support, outlining US efforts to counter it, and developing a strategy to discourage such support, including reviewing US financial assistance. The bill also requires reports on US-funded direct cash assistance programs in Afghanistan and the status of the Afghan Fund, focusing on Taliban influence and fund controls.",
