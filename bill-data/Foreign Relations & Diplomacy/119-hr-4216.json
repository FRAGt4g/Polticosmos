    "summary": "The FMS-Only List Review Act directs the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, to review the list of defense articles and services exclusively offered through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. The review aims to identify items that could also be sold via direct commercial sales. The bill mandates annual reviews, addressing factors like transfer timelines, impact on government workloads, and benefits to US national security and competitiveness. A report detailing the review's findings, including identified articles, reasons, and criteria, is to be submitted to relevant congressional committees.",
