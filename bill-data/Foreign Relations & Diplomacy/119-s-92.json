    "summary": "The 'Defending American Sovereignty in Global Pandemics Act' (S. 92) seeks to restrict U.S. involvement in any World Health Organization (WHO) agreement on pandemic preparedness and response. It mandates Senate approval via treaty ratification before the U.S. can join such an agreement. Furthermore, the bill proposes suspending U.S. funding to the WHO until the Senate ratifies any such agreement. The bill's aim is to safeguard U.S. sovereignty in the context of international health agreements and ensure Congressional oversight.",
