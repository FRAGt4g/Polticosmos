    "summary": "The Fraud Accountability and Recovery Act (H.R. 5548) amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit the President from providing assistance to countries that fail to extradite individuals convicted of defrauding the United States or assisting in the recovery of stolen funds. The bill highlights significant fraud losses, citing a specific case involving the misappropriation of over $250 million intended for feeding hungry children in Minnesota. It mandates a report on noncompliant countries and allows for a presidential waiver if national security is at stake. The bill aims to protect taxpayer dollars and prevent fraud, particularly regarding funds transferred internationally.",
