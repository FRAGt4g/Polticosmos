    "summary": "The 'Standing Against Houthi Aggression Act' aims to formally designate Ansarallah (the Houthis) as a foreign terrorist organization. It mandates the Secretary of State to make this designation within 90 days of the bill's enactment. Subsequently, the President is required to impose sanctions on Ansarallah and any affiliated foreign entities, including measures outlined in existing Executive Orders concerning terrorism and travel restrictions for Yemeni nationals. The bill cites historical context of Iranian support for the Houthis and past designations by the U.S. government.",
