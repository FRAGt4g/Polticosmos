    "summary": "The Peace Corps Modernization Act aims to improve the efficiency and foreign policy alignment of the Peace Corps. It mandates that no more than 15% of the Peace Corps budget is allocated to overhead, with the rest directed towards volunteers. The bill prioritizes country assignments based on U.S. strategic interests, requires a strategic plan aligned with the State Department, and mandates Peace Corps programs in at least five Pacific Island nations. It also focuses on coordinating with embassies, enhancing oversight, and creating a streamlined pathway for returning Peace Corps volunteers to join the Foreign Service.",
