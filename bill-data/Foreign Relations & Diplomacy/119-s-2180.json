    "summary": "The Global Respect Act of 2025 aims to impose sanctions on foreign persons responsible for human rights violations against LGBTQI individuals. It mandates the President to create and update a list of such individuals, who would then be ineligible for US visas and subject to potential removal from the country. The bill also calls for reports to Congress on the actions taken and discrimination tracking. Furthermore, it amends existing legislation to include violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in annual human rights reports.",
