    "summary": "The Export Controls Enforcement Act aims to strengthen the enforcement of United States export controls. It mandates the Secretary of Commerce to establish an Export Control Officer Program, which will station at least 20 export control officers at US diplomatic or consular posts for a 5-year period. These officers will conduct end-use checks, advise US posts, perform industry outreach, liaise with foreign governments, and share information with the Bureau of Industry and Security to prevent illegal diversion of US technologies and better enforce export controls.",
