    "summary": "The Uyghur Policy Act of 2025 addresses human rights concerns regarding Uyghurs and other minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of China. It calls on the PRC to protect the Uyghurs' distinct identity, allow international access to the XUAR, and release political prisoners. The Act directs the Secretary of State to prioritize Uyghur issues, coordinate with other agencies and countries, and support independent media. It mandates a strategy for pressuring China, requires Uyghur language training for diplomats, and instructs the US to advocate for Uyghur rights within the United Nations.",
