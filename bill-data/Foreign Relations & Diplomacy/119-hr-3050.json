    "summary": "This bill, the \"Countering Hate Against Israel by Federal Contractors Act,\" prohibits federal agencies from contracting with companies that boycott Israel. It mandates that companies certify they are not boycotting Israel to be eligible for covered contracts (over $100,000) and that such contracts include a prohibition on boycotting. The bill defines \"boycott of Israel\" and establishes a process for dealing with violations, including contract termination. It also includes clauses for appeal and specifies that the act should not infringe on First Amendment rights or take a position on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.",
