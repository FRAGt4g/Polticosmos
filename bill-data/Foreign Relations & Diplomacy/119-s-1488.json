It grants the Attorney General authority to issue civil investigative demands for information and create civil penalties for failing to meet registration requirements. The bill also introduces a sunset clause for the Attorney General's authority to issue civil investigative demands and mandates annual reports detailing their use, including the number of demands issued and the results.",
