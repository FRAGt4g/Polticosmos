    "summary": "The \"Chinese Currency Accountability Act of 2025\" (H.R. 386) requires U.S. officials at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to use their voice and vote to oppose any increase in the weight of China's renminbi in the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency basket. This directive can only be waived if the Treasury Secretary certifies to Congress that China is complying with its IMF obligations, has not manipulated its currency in the last year, and adheres to international credit rules. This policy requirement is set to expire 10 years after the bill's enactment.",
