    "summary": "The 'Neutralizing Unfair Chinese Export Subsidies Act of 2025' aims to address unfair trade practices by China. The bill mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a strategy to ensure China's compliance with OECD export credit standards in cooperation with allies. It amends the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2012 to reflect this goal and strengthens the Treasury's role in international negotiations regarding export subsidies. Furthermore, the bill outlines criteria for determining if China manipulates its currency and directs opposition to quota increases for China at the International Monetary Fund.",
