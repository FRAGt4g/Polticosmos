    "summary": "This bill, the Non-Recognition of Russian Annexation of Ukrainian Territory Act, aims to prohibit the U.S. government from recognizing Russia's claims of sovereignty over any part of Ukraine's internationally recognized territory. It explicitly states the U.S. policy of non-recognition, including airspace and territorial waters, and restricts federal agencies from actions that would imply such recognition. The bill's intent is to reinforce U.S. support for Ukraine's territorial integrity.",
