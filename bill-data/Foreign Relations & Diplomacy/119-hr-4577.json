    "summary": "The Defending American Property Abroad Act of 2025 aims to protect U.S. property rights abroad. The bill defines \"prohibited property\" based on nationalization or expropriation by foreign governments in the Western Hemisphere with free trade agreements with the U.S. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with other agencies, would identify and designate such property. The President would then prohibit vessels previously at these ports from importing goods, releasing passengers, or conducting maintenance in the U.S. It also amends the Trade Act of 1974 to include expropriation of U.S. assets within the definition of unfair trade practices.",
