    "summary": "The Secure America\u2019s Financial Exchanges Act (SAFE Act) amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to address the issuance of securities by Chinese entities. The bill mandates that exchanges require issuers to disclose information about financial support received from the Chinese government, including any conditions attached. It also necessitates disclosure of Chinese Communist Party committees within the issuer and information on officers/directors who hold positions within the Chinese Communist Party or government. The SEC must amend its rules within 180 days of the Act's enactment.",
