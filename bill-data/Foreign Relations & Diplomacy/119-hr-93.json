    "summary": "Introduced by Rep. Biggs, H.R. 93, the \"Stop Imposing Woke Ideology Abroad Act,\" seeks to prohibit federal funding for specific equity initiatives within the U.S. Department of State. The bill would block any federal funds from being used for the salary or expenses of the Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice. It would also defund any activities related to implementing or carrying out the Department of State's Equity Action Plan. This prohibition would take effect on the date the act is enacted, overriding any other provision of law.",
