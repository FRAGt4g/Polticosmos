    "summary": "This bill, the Western Hemisphere Nearshoring Act, aims to reduce U.S. dependency on Chinese manufacturing and address migration from the Western Hemisphere by incentivizing companies to relocate from China to Latin America and the Caribbean. It proposes using International Development Finance Corporation funds for moving expenses and workforce development, provides duty-free treatment, and imposes conditions on companies receiving assistance, including commitments against foreign adversary influence. It also addresses trade agreements, nuclear energy cooperation, and temporary tax benefits to encourage relocation. Finally, it establishes a trust fund using tariffs collected from China.",
