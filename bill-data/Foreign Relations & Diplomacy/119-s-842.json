    "summary": "The 'No Hezbollah In Our Hemisphere Act' aims to counter Hezbollah's terrorist activities in Latin America. It calls for an assessment of Latin American countries to determine if they meet the definition of terrorist sanctuaries, and outlines potential visa revocation sanctions for government officials in designated sanctuaries who don't take action against Hezbollah. The bill also tasks the Secretary of State with engaging Latin American governments to combat terrorism financing and encourages allies to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.",
