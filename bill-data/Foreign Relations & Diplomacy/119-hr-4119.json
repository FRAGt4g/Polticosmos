    "summary": "This bill, the Polisario Front Terrorist Designation Act, mandates the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury to determine within 90-180 days whether the Polisario Front meets criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist organization and for the imposition of sanctions. It requires reports on the group's leadership, foreign sponsorship, ties to Iran and Russia, and potential attacks on civilians. The President can waive sanctions if the Polisario Front negotiates in good faith the Moroccan autonomy plan for Western Sahara.",
