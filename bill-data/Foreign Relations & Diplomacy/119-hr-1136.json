    "summary": "This bill, the \u201cMake Gaza Great Again Act,\u201d aims to sanction foreign persons who refuse to cooperate with the United States in granting humanitarian entry to Palestinians from Gaza. It mandates the President to create a list of non-cooperative individuals and then imposes sanctions, including property blocking and visa ineligibility. The bill also allows for the suspension of foreign aid and major non-NATO ally designations for countries declining to assist. These sanctions have a sunset clause of five years, and the President has the ability to waive these sanctions under certain conditions. The legislation specifically excludes Israel.",
