    "summary": "The El Salvador Accountability Act of 2025 seeks to impose sanctions on the Bukele government in El Salvador, focusing on individuals involved in human rights violations, violation of international law, depriving individuals of constitutional rights, or providing support to those acts. Sanctions include blocking of property, visa restrictions, and prohibiting loans from US financial institutions. The bill also restricts US support to El Salvador through international financial institutions and requires reports on cryptocurrency use and corruption, as well as an annual report on US-El Salvador relations. Funding to the Salvadoran government is prohibited until specific conditions are met.",
