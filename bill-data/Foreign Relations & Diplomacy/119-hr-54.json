    "summary": "Introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs, the 'WHO Withdrawal Act' (H.R. 54) directs the President to immediately withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization. The bill prohibits any federal funds from being used for U.S. participation in the WHO or any successor organization. It also repeals the 1948 law that originally authorized America's initial membership and funding for the WHO. If enacted, this legislation would completely sever the legal and financial ties between the United States and the global health body, effective upon the bill's passage.",
