    "summary": "The 'Not A Trusted Organization Act' (S. 2174) introduced in the Senate aims to withdraw the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The bill mandates the President to denounce the North Atlantic Treaty, citing concerns about NATO's relevance after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the expansion of NATO despite prior assurances, and the financial burden the US shoulders. It also prohibits the use of federal funds for NATO contributions and includes a severability clause. The bill's core argument is that the US's continued membership in NATO is inconsistent with its national security interests.",
