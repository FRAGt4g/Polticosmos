    "summary": "The Pakistan Freedom and Accountability Act aims to address concerns about democracy and human rights in Pakistan. It acknowledges Pakistan as a US partner but highlights issues like undue military influence, restrictions on freedoms, and electoral interference. The bill mandates the President to identify Pakistani officials responsible for gross human rights violations and undermining democracy, potentially imposing sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act. The Act includes exemptions for humanitarian aid and national security activities and sunsets in 2030.",
