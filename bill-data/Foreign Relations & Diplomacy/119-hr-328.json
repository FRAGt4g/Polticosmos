    "summary": "This bill, the \"REVOCAR Act of 2025,\" prohibits U.S. persons and entities from transacting with or investing in Venezuela's energy sector. The measure is a response to the Maduro regime's refusal to recognize the results of the July 28, 2024, presidential election. The prohibition targets Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) and the Venezuelan government. The sanctions will terminate if the election results are honored or on December 31, 2027, whichever is earlier. The President may waive the prohibitions for 90-day periods if deemed vital to U.S. national security interests.",
