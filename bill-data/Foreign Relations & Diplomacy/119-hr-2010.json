    "summary": "The NATO Edge Act aims to prevent the President from withdrawing the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It amends Section 1250A of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 to make it more difficult to withdraw, requiring Senate consent or an Act of Congress, and mandating that remaining NATO members, who have not met the 2% GDP defense spending target, make a commitment to do so within 5 years. It also grants the Houses of Congress the ability to legally challenge withdrawals and sunsets on September 30, 2033.",
