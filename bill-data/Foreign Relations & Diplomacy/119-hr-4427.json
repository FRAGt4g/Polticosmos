    "summary": "The Syria Sanctions Accountability Act of 2025 focuses on reevaluating and adjusting US policies related to Syria. It mandates reviews of the Commercial Bank of Syria's exceptive relief, directs the Secretary of the Treasury to influence the IMF and World Bank regarding economic support and data reporting in Syria, and requires the Export-Import Bank to assess country limitations. The bill also modifies sanctions under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 by revising criteria for sanctions waivers and setting a new sunset clause dependent on Syria's compliance with specific conditions.
