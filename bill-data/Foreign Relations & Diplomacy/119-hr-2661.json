    "summary": "The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (HKETO) Certification Act requires the Secretary of State to determine if Hong Kong's HKETOs merit continued privileges and immunities, based on Hong Kong's autonomy from China. If Hong Kong is deemed to no longer have a high degree of autonomy, the HKETOs will terminate operations. The bill also limits US government agreements with HKETOs and outlines a US policy regarding promoting Hong Kong's autonomy, human rights, and rule of law.",
