It establishes an Office of the Coordinator within the Department of State, outlining its duties, including supporting voluntary departures from Afghanistan, coordinating interagency efforts for vetting and processing Afghan allies, and addressing family reunification. The bill mandates the collection and secure storage of data related to Afghan applicants and relocated individuals, requiring regular reports to Congress. It defines 'covered persons' eligible for assistance and sets a five-year sunset provision, with an exception for database maintenance.",
