    "summary": "This bill, the Defending International Security by Restricting Unacceptable Partnerships and Tactics Act (DISRUPT Act), addresses the growing cooperation among the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (North Korea), which the bill deems as the foremost adversaries of the United States. It mandates the executive branch to develop a whole-of-government strategy to disrupt this cooperation and mitigate risks to the U.S., including task forces, reports, and a strategic approach focusing on sanctions, diplomatic engagement, and bolstering deterrence.",
