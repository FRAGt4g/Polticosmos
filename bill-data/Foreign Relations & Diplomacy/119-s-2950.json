    "summary": "The Scam Compound Accountability and Mobilization Act aims to address international cyber-enabled fraud originating from scam compounds, particularly in Southeast Asia. It mandates the Secretary of State, in consultation with other agencies, to create a strategy and an interagency task force to counter these compounds, hold significant transnational criminal organizations accountable, and support victims. The bill authorizes sanctions, visa restrictions, and other measures against those involved in scam compound operations and requires regular reports to Congress. It also defines key terms and sets a sunset clause for the act.",
