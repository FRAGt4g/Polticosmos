    "summary": "The \u201cMEGOBARI Act\u201d aims to support democracy and the rule of law in Georgia. It expresses concern over democratic backsliding and increasing ties with Russia by the Georgian government. The bill calls for the suspension of the US-Georgia Strategic Partnership Commission, proposes sanctions against individuals undermining Euro-Atlantic integration or involved in corruption, and mandates reports analyzing Russian and Chinese influence. It also outlines US policy to support Georgia's Euro-Atlantic aspirations, potentially offering additional aid pending progress on democratic reforms. The act has a sunset clause after five years.",
