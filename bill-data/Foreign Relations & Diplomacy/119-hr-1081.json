    "summary": "The bill, titled the \"Preventing SBA Assistance from Going to China Act,\" aims to prevent certain business concerns from receiving assistance from the Small Business Administration (SBA). It amends the Small Business Act to specify that a concern is not considered a small business if it's located and incorporated in China or if over 25% of its voting stock is held by affiliates who are citizens of or organized under the laws of China. The bill's intention is to limit financial support to businesses with strong ties to the People's Republic of China.",
