The bill defines \"covered entities\" and \"countries of concern\" (primarily China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela), focusing on direct and portfolio investments. It aims to increase transparency regarding financial interactions that could pose national security risks, gathering data on the value and nature of these investments.",
