    "summary": "The Frank Connor and Trooper Werner Foerster Justice Act calls for the extradition or return to the United States of fugitives residing in Cuba who are wanted for criminal offenses committed in the U.S. It specifically names Joanne Chesimard and William \u201cGuillermo\u201d Morales, citing their past crimes. The bill asserts that Congress believes Cuba is obligated to extradite these individuals. It mandates an annual report from the Secretary of State regarding efforts to secure the return of the fugitives and assesses Cuba's compliance with extradition treaties. It also prohibits the use of certain international aid funds for Cuba until the regime complies with treaty obligations and other conditions.",
