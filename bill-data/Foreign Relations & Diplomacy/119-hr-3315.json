    "summary": "This bill, the 'No Hezbollah In Our Hemisphere Act,' addresses concerns about Hezbollah's activities in Latin America. It calls for an assessment of Latin American countries to determine if they meet the definition of 'terrorist sanctuary.' If designated, the bill allows for visa revocation of government officials from those countries. The President can waive these sanctions under specific circumstances, and such sanctions terminate after five years. The bill includes provisions for reporting to Congress and emphasizes the need for Latin American countries to combat terrorist financing.",
