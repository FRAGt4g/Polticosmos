    "summary": "The 'WHO is Accountable Act' (S.774) introduced in the Senate by Mrs. Blackburn aims to restrict U.S. funding to the World Health Organization (WHO). It prohibits using federal funds for WHO membership or contributions until the Secretary of State certifies the WHO meets specific conditions. These include reforms to prevent politicization of humanitarian aid, independence from the Chinese Communist Party, transparency, and cessation of certain activities deemed non-germane, such as gender identity messaging, climate change advocacy, and abortion access. The bill also stipulates that WHO directives cannot be legally binding on U.S. citizens or states.",
