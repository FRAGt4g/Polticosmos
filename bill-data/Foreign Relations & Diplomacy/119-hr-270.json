    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 270, would grant the Secretary of State new authority under the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956. It allows the Secretary to waive the costs of evacuating U.S. citizens whose lives are endangered by war or terrorism. Currently, citizens often finance evacuations through a repatriation loan program, requiring them to repay the government. This legislation would permit the forgiveness of that debt, relieving the financial burden on Americans brought home from dangerous international crises.",
