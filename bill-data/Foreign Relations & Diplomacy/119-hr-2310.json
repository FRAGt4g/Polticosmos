    "summary": "This bill, the \"China\u2019s Odious and Brutally Atrocious Labor Trafficking Supply Chain Act\" or COBALT Supply Chain Act, aims to prevent the importation of goods containing cobalt refined in China, due to concerns about forced labor and child labor in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) cobalt mines, often linked to Chinese companies.  It establishes a rebuttable presumption that such goods are produced with forced labor. The bill mandates an enforcement strategy, focusing on supply chain tracing and identifying entities involved. It also requires an annual certification that federal vehicle purchases are free of such labor practices.  The bill also targets the PRC\u2019s national security threat and coordinates with Mexico and Canada to prohibit the import of goods produced by forced labor.",
