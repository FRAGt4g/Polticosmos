    "summary": "This bill, the Uzbekistan Normalized Trade Act, aims to normalize trade relations with Uzbekistan. It authorizes the President to extend 'normal trade relations treatment' (nondiscriminatory treatment) to Uzbek products, effectively removing the application of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974. This can only happen after the President certifies to Congress that Uzbekistan has joined the World Trade Organization.",
