    "summary": "This bill, the Modernize the Au Pair Program Act of 2025, clarifies the Department of State's exclusive regulatory authority over the au pair program. It aims to prevent state and local governments from creating their own regulations. The bill mandates the Secretary of State to propose a revised rule within 90 days, focusing on a uniform, affordable stipend structure, increased flexibility for families with unique schedules (including military families and first responders), and the promotion of cultural immersion. The bill highlights the program's role in foreign policy and as a source of childcare.",
