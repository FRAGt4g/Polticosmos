    "summary": "This bill, the Preventing PLA Acquisition of United States Technology Act of 2025, aims to counter the Chinese Communist Party's military-civil fusion strategy. It prohibits covered entities (federal agencies, universities, and US-based companies receiving federal funds) from engaging in scientific research or technical exchanges with Chinese entities of concern that could contribute to the development of dual-use technologies. The bill requires the Secretary of Defense to create a website listing restricted research areas and Chinese entities of concern, mandates annual reporting from covered entities, and establishes enforcement mechanisms, including a ban on federal financial assistance for violations.",
