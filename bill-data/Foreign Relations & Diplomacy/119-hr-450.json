    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 450, titled the \"Fighting Oppression until the Reign of Castro Ends\" or \"FORCE Act,\" prohibits the President or the Secretary of State from removing Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. This restriction would remain in effect until the President determines that Cuba has met the conditions for a democratic transition as specified in the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996. The bill essentially ties any change in Cuba's terrorism designation directly to the establishment of a democratic government as defined by existing U.S. law.",
