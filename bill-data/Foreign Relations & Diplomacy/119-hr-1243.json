    "summary": "The United Nations Voting Accountability Act of 2025 aims to restrict U.S. assistance to foreign countries that consistently vote against the United States' position in the United Nations. It defines 'opposing the position of the United States' based on voting records in the General Assembly and Security Council. The Secretary of State can exempt a country if there's a significant government change. Exemptions are temporary and require congressional notification. The act specifies which types of assistance are covered and outlines the effective date tied to a Foreign Relations Authorization Act report.",
