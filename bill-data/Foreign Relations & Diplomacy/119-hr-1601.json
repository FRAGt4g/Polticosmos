    "summary": "This bill, the Defending Ukraine's Territorial Integrity Act, aims to counter Russian influence and aggression in Ukraine. It establishes a U.S. policy of non-recognition of Russian claims over Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia, including Crimea and several oblasts. The bill prohibits the use of U.S. funds to provide assistance to any government that recognizes Russian control over Ukrainian territories or supports Russia's annexation. The Secretary of State is required to publish a list of such governments and may waive the prohibition if it is in the national interest, with justification given to congressional committees.",
