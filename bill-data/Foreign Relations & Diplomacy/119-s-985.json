    "summary": "This bill, the \"Prevent Regulatory Overreach from Turning Essential Companies into Targets Act of 2025\" (PROTECT USA Act of 2025), aims to prevent companies deemed integral to U.S. national interests from complying with foreign sustainability due diligence regulations. It defines these \"essential companies\" broadly, covering sectors like extractive industries, manufacturing, national defense, and critical minerals. The bill prohibits compliance, provides for hardship relief (petitions to the President), and prevents adverse actions against these companies for non-compliance. It also bars recognition of foreign court judgments related to these regulations and empowers the President to take actions to protect these companies' interests.",
