    "summary": "The Solidify Iran Sanctions Act of 2025 aims to strengthen existing sanctions against Iran. The bill seeks to repeal the sunset provision of the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, thereby making the sanctions permanent. It cites concerns about Iran's weapons programs, support for terrorism (including through its Revolutionary Guards Corps), and the acquisition of destabilizing weapons systems. The bill's policy is to fully implement and enforce the 1996 Act.",
