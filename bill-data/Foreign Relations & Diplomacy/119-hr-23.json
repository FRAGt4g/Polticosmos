    "summary": "This bill, the 'Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act', requires the President to impose sanctions on any foreign person involved in the International Criminal Court's (ICC) efforts to investigate, arrest, or prosecute U.S. citizens or citizens of allied nations not party to the ICC, such as Israel. The sanctions include property blocking and visa bans for the individuals and their families. The legislation also rescinds all current and prohibits all future U.S. funding for the ICC. It includes a presidential waiver for national security, but sanctions can only be terminated once the ICC permanently ceases all such investigations.",
