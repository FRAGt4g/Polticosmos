    "summary": "The Use Sovereignty To reduce Rx Act (USTRx Act) addresses international trade practices affecting U.S. pharmaceutical innovation. It aims to counter foreign price controls that exploit U.S. research and development by undervaluing innovative drugs. The bill establishes a Chief Pharmaceutical Trade Negotiator within the Trade Act of 1974 to conduct negotiations, enforce agreements, and address unfair practices by high-income countries. The USTR is required to compile a list of such countries and report annually on their pharmaceutical trade practices, assessing their fairness and impact on U.S. interests, and outlining potential responses.",
