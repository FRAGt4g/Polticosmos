    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 94, seeks to terminate the designation of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan as a major non-NATO ally. Upon enactment, this status would be immediately revoked. The bill prohibits the President from redesignating Pakistan as a major non-NATO ally in the future unless specific conditions are met. These conditions require the President to certify to Congress that Pakistan is actively taking significant military and legal action to disrupt the Haqqani Network, prevent it from using Pakistani territory as a safe haven, and coordinate with Afghanistan to restrict militant movement.",
