    "summary": "The China Exchange Rate Transparency Act of 2025 aims to increase transparency regarding China's exchange rate policies. It mandates the United States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to advocate for greater transparency from China, including its currency management and interventions. The bill calls for enhanced surveillance by the IMF and consideration of China's performance when evaluating its voting shares. The requirement will end when China complies with IMF agreements or seven years after the bill's enactment. The bill cites concerns from the Treasury Department regarding China's lack of exchange rate transparency.",
