    "summary": "The 'Prohibition on Funding to CECOT Act' aims to prevent the use of federal funds to support the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) maximum security prison in El Salvador. The bill prohibits funding for the prison's construction, operation, personnel, and related services, including detention costs for individuals transported from the US. It mandates a report from the Secretary of State within 90 days, detailing previously allocated funds, current contracts, and plans for fund reallocation. The bill is motivated by human rights concerns regarding the CECOT prison.",
