    "summary": "The Global Health, Empowerment and Rights Act seeks to remove certain restrictions on foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that receive assistance under Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The bill aims to ensure these NGOs are not ineligible for assistance solely because of health or medical services (including counseling and referrals) provided with non-U.S. government funds, provided those services comply with local laws. It also seeks to prevent these NGOs from being subject to more restrictive requirements regarding advocacy and lobbying activities compared to U.S. NGOs receiving the same aid.",
