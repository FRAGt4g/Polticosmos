    "summary": "The Foreign Registration Obligations for Nonprofit Transparency Act (FRONT Act) amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. It mandates that certain tax-exempt organizations receiving funding from foreign principals of 'countries of concern' (e.g., China, Russia) register as foreign agents. The bill outlines specific reporting requirements, including detailed statements of activities and agreements related to foreign funding. It also defines 'countries of concern' and 'foreign principals,' and sets an effective date for the amendments.",
