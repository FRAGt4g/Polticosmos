    "summary": "The 'No Chinese Cars Act' amends the Trade Act of 1974 to give the Trade Representative greater authority to take action against foreign trade practices related to motor vehicles. It specifically targets motor vehicles from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and potentially other countries, by allowing trade actions like duties. The bill defines qualifying vehicles and outlines consultation requirements before modifying or terminating trade actions. Furthermore, it defines 'a firm of the foreign country'. The amendments take effect upon enactment.",
