    "summary": "The Pakistan Democracy Act aims to support a democratic Pakistan by authorizing sanctions against foreign individuals involved in the wrongful persecution and imprisonment of political opponents, specifically targeting those who undermined democracy and furthered military rule. The bill mandates the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions on General Asim Munir. Additionally, the President is required to identify individuals involved in such actions, making them inadmissible to the United States and revoking their visas.  The President can waive these sanctions under specific circumstances, providing briefings to Congress and defining relevant terms.",
