    "summary": "The Burma Genocide Accountability and Protection Act aims to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis involving Rohingya refugees and internally displaced persons in Burma (Myanmar). It calls for support and assistance to Rohingya, promotes accountability for the genocide and crimes against humanity committed against them by the Burma military, and seeks to isolate the military junta. The bill outlines policies related to humanitarian aid, justice, accountability, and the eventual safe repatriation of refugees while also authorizing the appointment of a Special Representative for Burma. It also lays out specific actions the Secretary of State should take, including support for protection, humanitarian efforts, and durable solutions, as well as promoting accountability for the crimes committed. The bill calls for reports to Congress on the progress of addressing the crisis.",
