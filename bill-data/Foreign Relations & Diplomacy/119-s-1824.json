    "summary": "The Taiwan PLUS Act aims to strengthen defense cooperation between the United States and Taiwan. It finds that Taiwan is a major trading partner and ally, and supports the continued provision of defense articles. The bill expresses the sense of Congress that enhanced defense cooperation is critical, including designating Taiwan as part of the \u201cNATO Plus\u201d community for Foreign Military Sales considerations.  The bill also allows Taiwan to be treated similarly to other allies for specific arms export regulations for a 5-year period, with possible extensions by the Secretary of State.",
