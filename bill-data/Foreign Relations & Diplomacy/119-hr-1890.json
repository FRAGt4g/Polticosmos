    "summary": "The Turkey Diplomatic Realignment Act proposes to reassign responsibility for Turkey within the U.S. Department of State from the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs to the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. The bill highlights Turkey's shifting geopolitical priorities, its strained relations with the West, and its growing engagement in the Middle East. It aims to better align diplomatic strategy and encourages national debate within Turkey about its future. The Secretary of State is mandated to implement the reassignment within 90 days of enactment and report on its effects after five years.",
