The bill mandates an interagency strategy, led by the Secretary of State, to increase international awareness, hold foreign governments accountable, and promote cooperation with allies. It also addresses training for relevant US officials, including those in the Department of State, Homeland Security, and Justice, and directs these departments to provide resources and outreach to communities vulnerable to transnational repression. The bill covers criminalization, law enforcement coordination, and analysis of data misuse concerns.",
