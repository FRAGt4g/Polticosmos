    "summary": "The 'Ending Lending to China Act of 2025' aims to oppose further lending from multilateral development banks (like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank) to China. The bill cites China's economic strength, high foreign exchange reserves, and exceeding the income threshold for assistance as reasons to end its eligibility for loans. It directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director at these banks to vote against such loans and requires annual reports on China's borrowing, representation at these institutions, and efforts to graduate countries exceeding income thresholds. The bill also defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" and \"multilateral development banks.\"",
