    "summary": "This bill, titled the \"No Russian Tunnel to Crimea Act\", directs the President to impose sanctions on any foreign person who knowingly participates in the construction, maintenance, or repair of a tunnel or bridge connecting the Russian mainland with the Crimean peninsula. The proposed sanctions include asset blocking and ineligibility for U.S. visas and admission. Citing Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the bill provides exceptions for humanitarian aid, international obligations, and intelligence activities. The President may also waive the sanctions for U.S. national security interests.",
