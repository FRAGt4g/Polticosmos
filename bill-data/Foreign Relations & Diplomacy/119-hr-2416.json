    "summary": "The Taiwan International Solidarity Act amends the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019. It clarifies that UN Resolution 2758 did not address Taiwan's representation and that the U.S. opposes any changes to Taiwan's status without its consent. The bill instructs U.S. representatives in international organizations to resist China's efforts to distort the 'One China' position and encourages allies to oppose China's attempts to undermine Taiwan's relationships. It also mandates a report on China's efforts.",
