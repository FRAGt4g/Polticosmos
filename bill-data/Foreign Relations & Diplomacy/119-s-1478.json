    "summary": "The Countering Wrongful Detention Act of 2025 aims to deter foreign countries from wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals. It allows the Secretary of State to designate countries as State Sponsors of Unlawful or Wrongful Detention, triggering reviews of U.S. responses, including sanctions and travel restrictions. The bill mandates briefings to Congress, requires air carriers to obtain passenger certifications regarding travel advisories to high-risk areas, establishes an Advisory Council on Hostage Taking and Unlawful or Wrongful Detention, and calls for a report evaluating hostage affairs and recovery components.",
