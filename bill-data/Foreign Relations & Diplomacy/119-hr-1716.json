    "summary": "The Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act of 2025 aims to deter Chinese aggression towards Taiwan. It mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to issue reports on financial institutions and accounts connected to senior Chinese officials, restricts financial services for their immediate families if those family members benefit from the mentioned funds and outlines exceptions and waiver possibilities. The bill also defines key terms, specifies reporting requirements, and sets penalties for violations. Ultimately, the bill seeks to limit financial dealings that could support Chinese actions that threaten Taiwan's security.",
