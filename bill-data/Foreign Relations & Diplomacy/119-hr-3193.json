    "summary": "The United States-Republic of Korea Digital Trade Enforcement Act aims to address perceived discriminatory digital trade practices by South Korea that negatively impact US businesses. The bill mandates the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to investigate and report on South Korean regulations that predesignate or post-estimate US online or digital platform operators and impose business restrictions. Upon an affirmative determination of harm, the USTR is authorized to take various protective measures, including initiating disputes through the World Trade Organization (WTO), conducting investigations under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, or seeking settlements under the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement.",
