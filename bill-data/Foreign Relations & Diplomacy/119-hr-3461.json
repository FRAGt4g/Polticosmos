    "summary": "This bill, the Confronting CCP Human Rights Abusers Act, mandates the inclusion of China's Ministry of Public Security\u2019s Institute of Forensic Science on the U.S. entity list, managed by the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce. This action aims to restrict the institute's activities due to its alleged involvement in human rights abuses, specifically related to the repression of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang. A presidential waiver is possible if the institute is deemed not to be engaging in activities harmful to U.S. foreign policy.",
