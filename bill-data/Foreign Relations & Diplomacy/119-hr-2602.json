It mandates that any reorganization requires specific statutory authorization and a detailed plan submitted to relevant committees. The plan must include descriptions of proposed changes, impact analyses on foreign policy interests, implementation timelines, workforce impact assessments, and certifications of legal compliance. Non-compliance results in funding restrictions.",
