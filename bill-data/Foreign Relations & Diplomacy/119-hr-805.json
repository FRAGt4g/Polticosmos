    "summary": "This bill, the \"End China's De Minimis Abuse Act,\" amends Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to modify administrative exemptions for imported goods. It aims to prevent the abuse of \"de minimis\" exemptions (allowing low-value goods to enter duty-free) by prohibiting splitting orders to circumvent regulations and by applying restrictions to goods subject to existing duties. It mandates the use of 10-digit classification codes for specific articles and imposes civil penalties for violations. The amendments take effect 30 days after enactment.",
