    "summary": "This bill, the Strengthening United States Leadership at the IDB Act, aims to bolster the United States' influence within the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). It directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director at the IDB to reduce the influence of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in IDB operations. This includes reviewing projects involving the PRC for national security risks and voting against those deemed risky or that increase the PRC's voting share. The bill also promotes increased procurement from U.S. and partner country entities and encourages collaboration between the IDB and the U.S. Development Finance Corporation.",
