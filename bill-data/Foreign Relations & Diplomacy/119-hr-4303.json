It establishes a Special Envoy for Humanitarian Aid Workers within the State Department, with the rank of ambassador, responsible for advocating for worker safety and investigating incidents of death or detention.  It mandates reports to Congress on aid worker environments and restricts U.S. aid to countries that unlawfully harm these workers.  An independent interagency group will investigate such incidents and report to Congress. The bill's ultimate goal is to enhance the safety and effectiveness of humanitarian operations.",
