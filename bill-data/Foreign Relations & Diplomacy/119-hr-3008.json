    "summary": "The Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act of 2025 aims to restore legal rights for claimants under Holocaust-era insurance policies. It creates a federal private cause of action, allowing beneficiaries to sue insurers to recover proceeds, overriding certain Supreme Court precedents and executive branch foreign policies that have hindered such claims. The bill clarifies definitions (e.g., \"beneficiary\", \"covered policy\") and sets a 10-year statute of limitations.  It also addresses the effect of prior judgments and releases, and preserves State laws except where they conflict with this act.",
