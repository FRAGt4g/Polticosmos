    "summary": "This bill, S. 218, aims to designate a section of 16th Street in Washington, D.C., as \"Oswaldo Pay\u00e1 Way.\" The bill highlights the life and activism of Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, a Cuban dissident who advocated for democratic freedoms and human rights. It cites his opposition to the Cuban government, his advocacy for freedom, and his death, which is believed by some to be the result of foul play. The bill also includes renaming the address of the Cuban embassy to reflect the new designation.",
