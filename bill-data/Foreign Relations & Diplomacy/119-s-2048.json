    "summary": "The 'PRC Military and Human Rights Capital Markets Sanctions Act of 2025' prohibits U.S. persons from purchasing, selling, or holding securities from specific Chinese entities. These 'covered entities' are defined based on connections to the Chinese military, human rights abuses, forced labor, and trade restrictions. The President is mandated to compile a public list of these entities, and U.S. persons must divest from related securities within a set timeframe. Violators face civil and criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.",
