    "summary": "The Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act of 2025 aims to promote greater participation of Taiwan in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The bill urges the U.S. Governor of the IMF to support Taiwan's admission, its participation in IMF surveillance activities, employment opportunities for Taiwanese nationals, and access to technical assistance. It also states U.S. policy not to deter Taiwan's membership bid and allows the Secretary of the Treasury to waive certain requirements under specific conditions. The bill highlights Taiwan's economic significance, reiterates existing U.S. policy towards Taiwan, and includes a sunset clause.",
