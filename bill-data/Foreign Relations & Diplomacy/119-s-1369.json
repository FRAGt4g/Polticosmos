    "summary": "The Protecting Global Fisheries Act of 2025 aims to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and the trade of endangered species. It authorizes the President to impose sanctions on foreign persons and vessels involved in these activities, including blocking property, denying access to U.S. ports, and prohibiting loans from U.S. financial institutions. The bill mandates reports and briefings to Congress on international collaboration, global fishing patterns, and strategies to counter IUU fishing, with a specific focus on the actions of the People's Republic of China. It also outlines waivers and exceptions to the sanctions.",
