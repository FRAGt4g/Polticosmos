    "summary": "The Deportation Compliance Act prohibits the allocation of federal funds for foreign assistance to countries that refuse or unreasonably delay accepting the return of their citizens, subjects, nationals, or residents who are subject to deportation under U.S. immigration laws. The bill specifically targets countries where the Secretary of State has already taken action by limiting visa issuance due to non-compliance with deportation orders, and then continues to deny or delay accepting these individuals after a 180-day period.",
