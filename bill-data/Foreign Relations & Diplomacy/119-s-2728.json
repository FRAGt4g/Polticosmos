    "summary": "This bill, the \"No Foreign Fundraising at United States Embassies Act,\" prohibits the use of U.S. embassies and consulates for fundraising activities on behalf of foreign political parties or candidates. It aims to ensure strict political neutrality and prevent the misuse of diplomatic resources for financial or electoral advantage. The bill amends existing legislation regarding official receptions and expenditures, requiring the Secretary of State to revise regulations to reflect these prohibitions and discourage activities that could be seen as promoting the financial interests of foreign parties. The Secretary of State must certify to Congress that these revisions are made.",
