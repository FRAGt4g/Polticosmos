    "summary": "This Senate bill, introduced by Mr. Sullivan, aims to prohibit the export of U.S.-produced or refined natural gas to foreign countries if the intent is to further export it through a foreign LNG terminal. The bill's justification centers on concerns regarding corruption and national security, specifically focusing on Mexico. It cites findings of corruption within Mexico's government, including fuel theft, judicial reforms that politicize the judiciary, and violations of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
