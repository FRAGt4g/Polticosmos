    "summary": "This bill amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. It establishes a 'conclusive presumption' that coastal states concur with certain activities, specifically those related to federal agency determinations and certifications.  It defines 'covered activities,' including those with significant national or regional economic impact, national security, critical infrastructure projects, and disaster recovery.  The Secretary of Commerce can nullify this presumption if an activity isn't considered 'covered'. The bill aims to streamline approval processes for projects in coastal zones, potentially speeding up development.",
