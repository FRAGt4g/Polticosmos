    "summary": "The 'Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2025' is a bipartisan bill that amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to increase government transparency. It mandates that the Secretary of Energy submit quarterly reports to congressional committees and make them publicly available. These reports must detail the Department of Energy's use of its authority to reduce or waive cost-sharing requirements for projects. The goal is to create public accountability and oversight for how and when the Department grants these financial waivers.",
