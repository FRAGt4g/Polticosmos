This includes areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, the South Atlantic Planning Area south of a certain latitude, and the Straits of Florida Planning Area. The bill amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to enforce these restrictions, with a clause stating that it does not affect existing leases.",
