    "summary": "This bill, the \"Proven Forest Management Act of 2025,\" directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to coordinate with local governments and stakeholders on forest management activities on federal lands. It requires activities to aim for multiple ecosystem benefits like fuel reduction and water quality improvement, unless costs are excessive. A key provision creates a categorical exclusion from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for certain fuel reduction projects up to 10,000 acres to expedite them. The bill also authorizes cooperative agreements for management activities on federal and non-federal lands.",
