    "summary": "The Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act of 2025 aims to amend the Clean Air Act to prevent the reallocation of renewable fuel obligations initially assigned to small refineries. The bill prohibits the EPA Administrator from reallocating these obligations when a small refinery has an exemption. It also mandates that the Administrator factor in the gasoline or diesel refined by such exempt refineries when calculating a person's overall renewable fuel obligations.",
