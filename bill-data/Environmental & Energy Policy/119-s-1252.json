It introduces a $1.00 credit per gallon equivalent of RNG sold or used as fuel in vehicles or aviation, with specific definitions for RNG and blended RNG. The bill addresses registration, double benefits, and energy equivalency related to RNG and provides for payments to those selling or using RNG. The credit would terminate after December 31, 2035. The Act focuses on reducing emissions and creating job opportunities.",
