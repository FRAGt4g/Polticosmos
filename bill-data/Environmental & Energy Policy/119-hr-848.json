    "summary": "This bill, the Voluntary Food Climate Labeling Act, directs the EPA to establish a voluntary program for labeling food products with their greenhouse gas emissions across their lifecycle. The program involves developing a visual label with numerical summaries, a QR code for detailed information, and a verification method adhering to international standards. Manufacturers can also make voluntary commitments to reduce emissions. The EPA will create a public database, issue reports, and update regulations. The bill includes penalties for misuse and aims to inform consumers and reduce food-related emissions.",
