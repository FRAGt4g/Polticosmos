    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 5042, aims to redefine the term \"showerhead\" for the purpose of determining acceptable water pressure. It repeals a previous Department of Energy rule (86 Fed. Reg. 71797) and states that the final rule from 85 Fed. Reg. 81341 shall have the force of law. The bill's definition of \"showerhead\" will impact energy conservation standards related to water usage in residential and commercial settings.",
