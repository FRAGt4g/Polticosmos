    "summary": "Introduced as H.R. 313, the \"Natural Gas Tax Repeal Act\" aims to eliminate a program regulating methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. The bill proposes the repeal of Section 136 of the Clean Air Act, which established a methane emissions and waste reduction incentive program for petroleum and natural gas systems, referred to in the bill's title as a \"natural gas tax.\" Additionally, the legislation would rescind any unspent federal funds that were previously allocated for this program.",
