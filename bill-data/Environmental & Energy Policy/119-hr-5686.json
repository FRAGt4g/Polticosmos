    "summary": "The 'Battery Fire Prevention Act' aims to prevent battery fires and promote recycling. It introduces a tax credit for businesses purchasing battery detectors using technologies like X-ray or AI, and imposes a 5% tax on battery sales. Revenue from the tax funds a Lithium Battery Buy-Back Trust Fund, used for a National Battery Recycling Program under the Department of Energy, which will provide grants and financial incentives for lithium battery recycling facilities. The bill also prioritizes the federal government buying lithium batteries from approved recycling facilities. The effective date for the tax and credits is January 1, 2026.",
