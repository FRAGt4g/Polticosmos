It defines key terms like \"covered land\" and \"renewable energy project\" and addresses the disposition of revenues generated from these projects. The bill outlines how the revenue will be distributed: 25% to the state, 25% to the counties, 25% to the Secretary for program implementation, and 25% to the Renewable Energy Resource Conservation Fund. The Fund will be used for conservation efforts related to supporting fish and wildlife habitation, as well as preserving and improving recreational access. The bill includes grandfathering clauses for existing projects and requires a yearly report to Congress.",
