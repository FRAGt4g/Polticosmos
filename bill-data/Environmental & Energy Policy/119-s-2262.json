    "summary": "The 'American Voices in Federal Lands Act' amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. It clarifies the definition of 'public involvement' to specify that it's limited to U.S. citizens. For Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands, the Secretary can only consider public comments from U.S. citizens and must implement a CAPTCHA system to prevent AI-generated input in public involvement processes. The bill aims to modify the process by which land management regulations are implemented and considers public comment.",
