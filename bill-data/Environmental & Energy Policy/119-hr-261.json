    "summary": "H.R. 261, titled the \"Undersea Cable Protection Act of 2025,\" amends the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. It aims to streamline the authorization process for undersea fiber optic cables in national marine sanctuaries. The bill prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from requiring a separate authorization for the installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of these cables if another Federal or State agency has already issued a license, lease, or permit for the same activity. This prevents duplicative regulatory requirements for critical infrastructure projects and directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to engage in interagency cooperation for such projects.",
