    "summary": "H.R. 105, the \"Increasing Public Access to Recreation Act,\" seeks to enhance public access to recreational areas on federal lands by amending Title 54 of the U.S. Code. The bill proposes increasing the percentage of funds set aside for recreational public access from 3 percent to 10 percent. It also raises the monetary cap for this allocation from $15,000,000 to $50,000,000. This legislation would substantially boost the financial resources available for projects that create or improve public entry to federal recreational sites, likely from the Land and Water Conservation Fund.",
