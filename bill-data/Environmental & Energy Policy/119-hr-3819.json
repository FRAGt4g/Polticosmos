    "summary": "The 'Prioritizing Revised Operations To Eliminate Cyanobacteria Toxins in Florida Act' (PROTECT Florida Act) directs the Army Corps of Engineers to prioritize public health in managing water infrastructure in Central and Southern Florida, particularly regarding harmful algal blooms. It defines public health in this context, mandates modifications to operational procedures, requires an updated Master Operational Manual, and calls for a study on pollution and nutrient loading. The bill forbids using restoration funds for Deep Well Injection and authorizes necessary appropriations. It does not alter existing water quality standards or project schedules while ensuring water quality for Everglades restoration.",
