    "summary": "The 'Stop Giving Big Oil Free Money Act' aims to prevent the Secretary of the Interior from issuing new oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico to companies that haven't renegotiated existing leases. The renegotiation would require these companies to pay royalties if oil and natural gas prices exceed specific thresholds. The bill also allows existing leaseholders to amend their leases to include such price thresholds, impacting royalty suspension provisions. In essence, it aims to increase government revenue from oil and gas production when prices are high.",
