    "summary": "The Smoke and Heat Ready Communities Act of 2025 aims to amend the Clean Air Act to provide grants to air pollution control agencies for programs addressing wildfire smoke and extreme heat. It defines extreme heat, outlines eligible activities for grant funds (monitoring, outreach, equipment, air filtration, PPE), and mandates a formula for allocating funds. The bill also establishes centers of excellence at institutions of higher education for research on related health effects, along with a competitive grant program for community planning, and authorizes appropriations for these initiatives.",
