    "summary": "The 'Protect Americans from Climate Disasters Act' aims to bolster the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to better prepare for and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events. The bill mandates rehiring of NOAA employees laid off since January 20, 2025, requires the continuation of existing programs supporting state and local efforts, and reinstates specific NOAA data products (Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters, Marine Environmental Buoy Database, and Global Ocean Currents Database). It also appropriates $6,756,300,000 for NOAA's expenses in fiscal year 2026.",
