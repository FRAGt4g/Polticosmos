    "summary": "The 'Ending Presidential Overreach on Public Lands Act' (S. 220) aims to restrict the President's authority to establish or expand national monuments. The bill amends Section 320301 of Title 54, United States Code (the Antiquities Act), to require express authorization from Congress for any new national monument creation or extension. This would shift the power to designate protected lands from the executive branch to the legislative branch.",
