    "summary": "The 'Cross-Boundary Wildfire Solutions Act' directs the Comptroller General of the United States to study existing programs, rules, and authorities related to wildfire mitigation across land ownership boundaries (Federal and non-Federal). The study will examine which programs enable or inhibit mitigation efforts, assess whether changes could improve agency/government capacity and access to funding, and analyze the effectiveness of activities under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. A report with findings and recommendations will be submitted to relevant congressional committees within two years of enactment.",
