    "summary": "The Climate Adaptation Plan Act of 2025 directs the EPA Administrator to establish a grant program to help eligible entities (local governments, tribal organizations, etc.) develop climate adaptation plans. These plans must assess climate change risks to the population, ecosystems, housing, infrastructure, and public buildings. The bill prioritizes applications from entities including an environmental justice community and defines key terms, including 'environmental justice community' and 'climate adaptation plan'.",
