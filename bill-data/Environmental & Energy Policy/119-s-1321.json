    "summary": "This bill, the Moab UMTRA Project Transition Act of 2025, amends the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 to facilitate the transfer of the Moab uranium mill tailings site to Grand County, Utah. The transfer is contingent on the site achieving a remedial action completion status, as determined by the Secretary of Energy. The bill includes provisions for retaining certain water rights, prohibiting reconveyance to private entities, and allowing for additional terms to protect U.S. interests. This aims to transition ownership and responsibility for the site to the local county.",
