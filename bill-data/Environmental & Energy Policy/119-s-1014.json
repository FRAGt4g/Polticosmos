    "summary": "This bill, the Maintaining Cooperative Permitting Act of 2025, aims to ensure that certain permit approvals by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have the force of law. It ratifies and approves existing state permit programs for the discharge of dredged or fill material under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, preventing the EPA from withdrawing approval without Congressional authorization. The bill specifically addresses programs in Michigan, New Jersey, and Florida, and outlines a transition period for Florida's program. It also establishes a process for approving comparable state programs and clarifies that such approvals are not considered rules or regulations.",
