    "summary": "The Nuclear REFUEL Act (H.R. 3978) proposes to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. It aims to exclude reprocessing spent nuclear fuel in a manner that doesn't separate plutonium from other transuranic elements from the definition of a \"production facility.\" The bill, introduced in the House of Representatives on June 12, 2025, seeks to clarify regulations related to nuclear fuel reprocessing and potentially expedite licensing for such facilities.",
