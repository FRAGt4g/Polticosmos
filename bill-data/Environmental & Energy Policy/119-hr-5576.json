    "summary": "The Enhancing Geothermal Production on Federal Lands Act aims to streamline geothermal energy exploration and development on federal lands. It amends the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to expedite exploration by defining 'geothermal exploration projects' and exempting them and related 'covered activities' from being considered major federal actions under NEPA.  The bill also mandates the designation of geothermal leasing priority areas, with environmental review requirements, and emphasizes the use of existing categorical exclusions to speed up approval processes.",
