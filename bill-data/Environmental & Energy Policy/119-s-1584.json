    "summary": "The Transparency and Honesty in Energy Regulations Act of 2025 prohibits federal agencies from considering the 'social cost' of greenhouse gases (including carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide) in their actions, including rulemakings, guidance, and cost-benefit analyses. It mandates a report to Congress on past uses of these metrics and prioritizes the use of robust methodologies, aligning environmental analysis with OMB Circular A-4. The bill effectively aims to limit the influence of climate change cost estimates in federal agency decision-making.",
