    "summary": "This bill, the Fair, Affordable and Inclusive Rates Act (FAIR Act), amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. It prohibits state regulatory authorities from approving rates charged by electric utilities that engage in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices deemed discriminatory, or that mandate certain ideological training. The bill also prevents approval of rates if utilities consider environmental, social, or governance (ESG) factors in rates or operational decisions, with some exceptions for compliance with existing laws. The intent of the bill is to limit how electric utilities operate and set rates based on diversity initiatives and environmental concerns.",
