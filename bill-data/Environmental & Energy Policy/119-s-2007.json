    "summary": "The Financing Lead Out of Water Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify private business use requirements for bonds issued for lead service line replacement projects. The bill clarifies that qualified lead service line replacement use does not constitute private business use, allowing for public water systems to use bond proceeds to replace privately-owned portions of lead service lines to comply with lead regulations. The amendments apply to obligations issued after December 31, 2025.",
