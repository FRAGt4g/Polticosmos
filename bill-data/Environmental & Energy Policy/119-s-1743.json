The study will quantify the dollar value of loss of life and property, evaluate health impacts, property damage, and consider factors like medical assistance, insurance claims, worker's compensation, labor productivity losses, and infrastructure impacts. The study also requires public reporting of findings and recommendations for a national system for tracking healthcare costs, heat death reporting, and productivity losses. The bill authorizes $3.5 million for this study.",
