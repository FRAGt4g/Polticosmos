    "summary": "The Star-Spangled Summit Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a 10-year special use permit for the placement and maintenance of a flagpole bearing the U.S. flag at Kyhv Peak Lookout Point in Utah. The permit will initially be offered to Robert S. Collins of Provo, Utah. If he declines, the permit goes to a qualified person residing in or operating in Utah County. The bill outlines the application process, prioritizes previous permit holders, and exempts the permit from land use fees and NEPA. It also addresses permit renewal, early termination, and prohibits permit holders from receiving compensation for identifying a subsequent permit holder. Access to the Lookout Point will be granted for permit holders, contingent on safety and resource protection.",
