    "summary": "The Zero-Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy Act of 2025 mandates that specific federal agencies, primarily those related to energy and natural resources, implement sunset dates for existing and future regulations. Existing regulations must expire within a year, and new regulations within five years, unless extended. Extensions require public comment and a determination of their continued necessity, or in the case of deregulatory amendments, are automatically granted. This act aims to increase accountability and reduce the longevity of regulations within the specified agencies, potentially impacting the energy sector and environmental regulations.",
