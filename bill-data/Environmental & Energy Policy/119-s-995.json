    "summary": "The Choice in Automobile Retail Sales Act of 2025 aims to repeal the EPA's multi-pollutant emissions standards for light-duty and medium-duty vehicles. It amends the Clean Air Act to prevent tailpipe regulations from limiting the availability of new motor vehicles. The bill mandates that regulations cannot dictate specific technologies or restrict vehicle availability based on engine type. The EPA Administrator is required to revise existing regulations accordingly within two years of the Act's enactment.",
