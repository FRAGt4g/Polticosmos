    "summary": "The Green Federal Fleet Act aims to transition the federal government's vehicle fleet to zero-emission vehicles. It prohibits federal agencies from purchasing or leasing non-tactical passenger vehicles that are not zero-emission vehicles, with an exemption for situations where such vehicles are not technically feasible. The bill defines \"zero-emission vehicle\" and \"Federal agency,\" and specifies that the prohibition does not apply to purchases or leases made prior to the act's enactment.",
