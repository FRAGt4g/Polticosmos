    "summary": "This bill, the Revising and Enhancing Project Authorizations Impacted by Review Act of 2025 (REPAIR Act), aims to streamline judicial review processes for projects requiring federal authorization. It establishes specific statute of limitations for claims, prioritizes remand as a default remedy over vacatur, and limits standing to those suffering direct harm. It introduces a mediation process overseen by the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council when authorizations are challenged. The bill also addresses venue for judicial review and random case assignments. It includes a public database of cases and reporting requirements to improve transparency and efficiency. This bill also prevents creating additional NEPA litigation rights",
