    "summary": "This bill, the State Planning for Reliability and Affordability Act, amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. It mandates that states, when planning for electric utilities, consider and ensure reliable electric energy availability over a 10-year period. This includes maintaining or procuring electricity from reliable generation facilities, defined by operational characteristics and fuel supply capabilities. The bill also outlines timelines for states to consider and act on this new standard.",
