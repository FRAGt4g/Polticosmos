    "summary": "The Clean Air and Economic Advancement Reform Act (CLEAR Act) amends the Clean Air Act to facilitate state implementation of national ambient air quality standards. It modifies timelines for reviews, considers attainability, addresses state deficiency corrections, and revises regulations on ozone nonattainment areas and particulate matter. The bill adds provisions for handling \"exceptional events\" and actions to mitigate wildfire risk when evaluating air quality. It also modifies the composition of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and requires the consideration of potential adverse effects when setting air quality standards. It introduces a new section in the Clean Air Act to determine sanctions and fees of emissions beyond control.",
