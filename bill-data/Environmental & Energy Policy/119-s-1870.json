    "summary": "The Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act (S. 1870) aims to adjust the boundary of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor.  It amends the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978, detailing the new boundary using specific maps. The Secretary of the Interior can make minor boundary revisions.  The bill also clarifies that the added land will be managed like the existing recreation area and that the addition will not affect existing utilities, but requires activities to minimize environmental impact.",
