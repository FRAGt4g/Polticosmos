    "summary": "The Sloan Canyon Conservation and Lateral Pipeline Act amends existing legislation related to the Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area. It adjusts the boundary of the conservation area, increasing its acreage. Crucially, it grants the Southern Nevada Water Authority a right-of-way for a water pipeline, powerlines, and access roads, subject to specific conditions to protect the conservation area's resources. The bill details requirements for the pipeline's construction, excavation, and disposal of materials, while also addressing existing rights and utility corridors within the conservation area.",
