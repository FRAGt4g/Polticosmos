    "summary": "This bill, the Northeast Fisheries Heritage Protection Act of 2025, aims to prohibit commercial offshore wind energy development in Lobster Management Area 1 in the Gulf of Maine. It cites the historical and economic importance of the New England fishing industry and the potential conflicts with offshore wind projects. The bill finds that the area is an important fishing ground and calls for a study by the Comptroller General to assess the environmental review processes of federal agencies for offshore wind projects in the Gulf of Maine, examining their impacts on marine life, fishing industries, and other resources. Additionally, it defines Lobster Management Area 1 by referencing existing regulations.",
