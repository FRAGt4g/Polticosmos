    "summary": "The Securing America\u2019s Critical Minerals Supply Act aims to address vulnerabilities in the supply chains of critical energy resources. It directs the Secretary of Energy to assess the criticality of these resources, the vulnerability of their supply chains, and the impact of imports on U.S. energy security. The bill mandates the development of strategies to strengthen these supply chains by diversifying sources, increasing domestic production, developing alternatives, and improving recycling. It amends the Department of Energy Organization Act, defining \u201ccritical energy resource\u201d and assigning functions related to securing their supply.",
