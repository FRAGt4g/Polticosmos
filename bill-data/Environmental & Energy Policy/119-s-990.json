    "summary": "The Freedom to Haul Act of 2025 aims to prevent enforcement of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Phase 3 emission rules for heavy-duty vehicles. It also amends the Clean Air Act to ensure that tailpipe regulations do not restrict the availability of new motor vehicles based on engine type or mandate specific technologies. The bill mandates the EPA to revise existing regulations accordingly within two years of the Act's enactment.",
