    "summary": "The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail Completion Act mandates the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to prioritize the completion of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail within 10 years of enactment. It establishes a joint Forest Service-Bureau of Land Management team to facilitate completion, develop a comprehensive development plan, and consult with stakeholders. The bill also encourages partnerships with volunteer and nonprofit organizations and clarifies that it does not expand land acquisition authority beyond existing law, nor does it prioritize land acquisition over other authorizations.",
