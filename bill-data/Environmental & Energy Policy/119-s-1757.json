    "summary": "The Efficient Nuclear Licensing Hearings Act aims to streamline the process for approving nuclear facility construction and operation. It amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to modify hearing procedures by allowing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue permits and licenses without a hearing in certain cases, after providing notice. It also introduces informal adjudicatory procedures for hearings and makes other revisions to the licensing process for uranium enrichment facilities. The amendments apply to pending applications.",
