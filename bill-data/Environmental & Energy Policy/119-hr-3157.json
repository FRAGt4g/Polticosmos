    "summary": "The State Energy Accountability Act amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. It mandates that state regulatory authorities evaluate the effects of state intermittent energy policies (policies promoting non-reliable energy sources like wind and solar) on the reliability of the bulk-power system, including resource adequacy, ability to meet demand during emergencies, effects on rates, and the need for out-of-state resources. The bill defines \u201cintermittent energy policy\u201d and \u201creliable generation facility.\u201d States must make these evaluations public.",
