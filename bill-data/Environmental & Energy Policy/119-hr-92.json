    "summary": "The 'Strategic Production Response and Implementation Act' prohibits drawdowns from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), except during a severe energy supply interruption, unless the Secretary of Energy first implements a plan. This plan must increase oil and gas leasing on Federal lands by a percentage equal to the SPR drawdown percentage. This total increase in leasing is capped at 10%. The bill requires the plan to be developed in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, the Interior, and Defense, tying SPR releases to an expansion of domestic energy production.",
