    "summary": "The Reliable Power Act (H.R. 3616) mandates the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to review regulations that might affect the reliability of the bulk-power system. The bill requires the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to notify FERC if the bulk-power system is at risk of generation inadequacy. FERC then notifies relevant federal agencies, such as the Department of Energy and the EPA, and reviews their actions that affect generation resources. Federal agencies must respond to FERC's comments and ensure their actions do not harm the reliability of the system. The bill also includes provisions for an annual long-term assessment of the bulk power system.",
