    "summary": "H.R. 1926 proposes an amendment to the Mineral Leasing Act. The bill's primary objective is to facilitate the commingling of oil and gas production from various sources (leases, unit areas, etc.) before royalty measurement. The Secretary of the Interior is mandated to approve applications for this practice, promoting surface disturbance minimization. It requires applicants to either use individual measurement devices or employ allocation methods that maintain an accuracy of plus or minus 2 percent for monthly production reporting.",
