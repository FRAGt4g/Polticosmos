    "summary": "The Water Conservation Rebate Tax Parity Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to expand tax exclusions for subsidies related to water conservation, storm water management, and wastewater management measures. It includes subsidies provided by public utilities, state, or local governments for these purposes, defining relevant terms like \"water conservation or efficiency measure\" and \"storm water management measure.\" The amendments are retroactive to amounts received after December 31, 2021. The Bill's intent is to create tax parity for water-related conservation efforts.",
