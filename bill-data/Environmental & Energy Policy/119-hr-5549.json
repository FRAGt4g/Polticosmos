    "summary": "The Efficient Nuclear Licensing Hearings Act aims to streamline the process for approving nuclear facility construction and operation. It amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to modify hearing procedures, allowing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue permits and licenses with less stringent requirements, such as through informal adjudicatory procedures and reduced public notice periods under certain conditions. The bill's amendments apply to pending applications before the NRC.",
