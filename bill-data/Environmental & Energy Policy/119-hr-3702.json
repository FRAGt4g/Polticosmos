The study, conducted through the Climate Program Office and in coordination with relevant agencies, will assess health impacts (mortality/morbidity), property damage, and various economic factors like medical expenses, insurance claims, labor productivity losses, infrastructure impacts, and energy costs. The study will solicit feedback from governmental and non-governmental entities, provide recommendations for tracking costs and improving reporting, and authorize its findings for public use, including peer-reviewed publication. The bill authorizes $3.5 million for this purpose.",
