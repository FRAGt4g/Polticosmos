    "summary": "The Wildfire Resilient Communities Act (H.R. 4295) aims to provide mandatory funding for hazardous fuels reduction projects on federal land. The bill defines key terms, prioritizes projects based on wildfire risk and community location, and allocates $30 billion to agency heads for these projects.  It also provides additional funding for the Community Wildfire Defense Grant Program, reauthorizes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, and establishes a County Stewardship Fund to distribute funds to counties involved in related contracts.",
