    "summary": "The Spent Fuel Prioritization Act of 2025 amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to prioritize the acceptance of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. The Secretary of Energy will prioritize based on reactor operating status, population density around the reactor, earthquake hazard, and national security risks. Highest priority is given to decommissioned reactors, those in densely populated areas, areas with high earthquake risk, and those posing significant national security concerns due to waste storage.",
