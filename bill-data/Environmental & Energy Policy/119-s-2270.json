    "summary": "The Myakka Wild and Scenic River Act of 2025 designates segments of the Myakka River in Sarasota County, Florida, as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.  The bill outlines specific river segments and their classifications (scenic, wild, recreational).  It mandates the Secretary of the Interior to manage the river in partnership with the Myakka River Management Coordinating Council. It emphasizes cooperative agreements with local and state entities for long-term protection, limiting land acquisition to donation or owner consent. This ensures the river's preservation through existing and new partnerships.",
