    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 1651, aims to nullify a final rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This rule addresses greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and also repeals the Affordable Clean Energy Rule. The bill's intent is to prevent the EPA's regulations on emissions from taking effect, effectively limiting environmental protections related to power plants.",
