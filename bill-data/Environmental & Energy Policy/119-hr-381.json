    "summary": "The \"LNG Public Interest Determination Act of 2025\" amends the Natural Gas Act to redefine the criteria for authorizing natural gas exports. It requires the Secretary of Energy to determine that proposed exports are consistent with the public interest only if they do not significantly contribute to climate change, materially increase domestic energy prices, or create disproportionate environmental justice impacts. The bill mandates detailed assessments on climate, economic, and environmental justice factors, including lifecycle emissions and impacts on vulnerable communities. It also ensures public participation and removes a categorical exclusion for LNG exports under environmental law.",
