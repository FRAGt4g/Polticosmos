    "summary": "The Critical Mineral Brine Extraction Research and Development Act directs the Secretary of Energy to support research and development for extracting critical minerals from brine. The goal is to reduce U.S. reliance on imported minerals by fostering cost-effective and environmentally friendly domestic extraction technologies. The bill mandates demonstrations, collaboration with the private sector, and a report to Congress on technical and economic feasibility.  It authorizes $2 million annually from 2026-2030 for these activities.",
