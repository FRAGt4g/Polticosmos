    "summary": "The Defend our Coast Act (HR 2886) introduced in the House of Representatives aims to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The bill specifically seeks to prevent the Secretary from issuing leases for oil and gas exploration, development, or production on the outer Continental Shelf within the Mid-Atlantic Planning Area. This effectively withdraws that area from potential disposition for oil and gas activities, referencing the 2024-2029 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program.",
