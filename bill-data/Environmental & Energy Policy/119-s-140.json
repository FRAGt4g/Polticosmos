    "summary": "The Wildfire Prevention Act of 2025 aims to address the forest health crisis on federal lands. It establishes goals for hazardous fuels reduction, requires annual reports on treatments and challenges, and promotes transparency in reporting hazardous fuels reduction activities.  The bill also addresses forest management practices, including vegetation management near electric facilities, timber sales, and the use of grazing for fire risk reduction. Finally it calls for a cultural change within agencies, including mandatory use of existing authorities and a public-private partnership for wildfire technology deployment.",
