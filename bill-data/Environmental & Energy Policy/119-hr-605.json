    "summary": "The Headwaters Protection Act of 2025 amends the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 to reauthorize and improve the Water Source Protection Program. It expands the definition of eligible partners, outlines project priorities (water supply, forest health, and risk management benefits), sets conditions for projects on adjacent land, and emphasizes non-Federal partner involvement. The bill also improves the watershed condition framework and authorizes appropriations for the program, aiming to protect and restore water sources and forest health. The bill also highlights that it will not supersede State or Federal water law or authorize federal land acquisition or control.",
