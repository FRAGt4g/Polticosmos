    "summary": "The \"Red Snapper Act of 2025\" is a bipartisan bill that prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from implementing area or bottom closures for the snapper-grouper fishery in the South Atlantic. This restriction would remain in place until the \"South Atlantic Great Red Snapper Count\" study is finished and its findings are incorporated into the official stock assessment. The bill argues this is necessary to prevent negative economic impacts on the region, which relies on recreational and commercial fishing, and to ensure future management decisions are based on the newest scientific data.",
