    "summary": "This bill, the \"Action Versus No Action Act,\" seeks to streamline the environmental review process for certain forest management activities. It requires that for specific collaborative projects on lands suitable for timber production, the environmental assessment or impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) must only consider two alternatives: the proposed project (the action) and a \"no action\" alternative. The bill specifies that the analysis of the \"no action\" alternative must evaluate potential negative outcomes, such as effects on forest health, wildfire potential, and habitat diversity.",
