    "summary": "H.R. 135, the 'Manatee Protection Act of 2025,' is a bipartisan bill that directs the federal government to reclassify the West Indian manatee as an 'endangered species' under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The bill mandates that, notwithstanding any other law, the Secretary of the Interior must add the manatee to the official endangered species list. This action aims to restore the highest level of federal legal protection for the species to enhance its conservation and address increasing threats to its survival.",
