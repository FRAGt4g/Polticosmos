    "summary": "The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act of 2025 amends existing law to clarify regulations surrounding hardrock mining mill sites. It allows for multiple mill site locations, defines mill sites and related terms, and establishes an Abandoned Hardrock Mine Fund. The fund is supported by claim maintenance fees from mill sites and will be used for environmental remediation efforts related to abandoned mines, as outlined in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The bill explicitly states that mill sites do not convey mineral rights.",
