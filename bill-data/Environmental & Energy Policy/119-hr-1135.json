    "summary": "The 'Polluters Pay Climate Fund Act of 2025' proposes establishing a fund to address climate change impacts. It imposes a tax on fossil fuel emissions based on historical carbon dioxide emissions from 2000-2023. The revenue collected will create the \"Polluters Pay Climate Fund,\" used for climate resilience, adaptation, disaster response, and environmental justice initiatives. The bill also has provisions specifying the fund's uses, setting aside money for environmental justice communities, and not preempting existing state/local climate laws or remedies for climate-related harms.",
