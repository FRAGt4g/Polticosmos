    "summary": "This bill amends the Aquifer Recharge Flexibility Act to streamline the process for using existing rights-of-way, such as canals on public land, for replenishing aquifers. It clarifies that holders of these rights can transport water for states, tribes, or public entities without needing new federal authorization, provided they give 30 days' notice to the Bureau of Land Management. The bill exempts these non-profit uses from additional rent payments. It also specifies that this flexibility does not waive compliance with major environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act or authorize new infrastructure construction.",
