    "summary": "The 'Tar Sands Tax Loophole Elimination Act' aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It clarifies that products derived from tar sands are to be considered crude oil for federal excise tax purposes, thus closing a potential tax loophole. The bill also grants the Secretary authority to include other fuel feedstocks or products under the tax, with conditions based on the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and commercial production quantity.",
