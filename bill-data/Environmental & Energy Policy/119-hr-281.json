    "summary": "The Grizzly Bear State Management Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of the Interior to remove the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear population from the Federal list of endangered and threatened wildlife. It mandates the reissuance of a specific 2017 delisting rule within 180 days of enactment. The bill is notable for stipulating that this action must be taken regardless of other applicable laws and, crucially, that the decision will not be subject to judicial review, preventing legal challenges to the delisting.",
