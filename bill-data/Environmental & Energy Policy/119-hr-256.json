    "summary": "H.R. 256, titled the \"Save America\u2019s Valuable Energy Act\" or \"SAVE Act,\" amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to prohibit the sale of petroleum products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to certain foreign entities. Specifically, the bill forbids selling SPR oil to any company headquartered in Russia or in any country listed in federal regulations as being subject to a U.S. arms embargo (22 C.F.R. \u00a7 126.1). The legislation aims to prevent strategic U.S. energy reserves from being acquired by adversarial nations, thereby strengthening national security.",
