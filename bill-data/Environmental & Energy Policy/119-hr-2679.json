    "summary": "The Cool Roof Rebate Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program providing rebates to eligible households for purchasing and installing cool roof products. Rebate amounts vary based on roof slope and the product's solar reflectance and thermal emittance (or Solar Reflectance Index). The program terminates in 2030, with a reporting requirement to Congress to detail program participation. Appropriations of $25 million annually are authorized from 2026-2030, alongside $600,000 for updating the Cool Roof Calculator.",
