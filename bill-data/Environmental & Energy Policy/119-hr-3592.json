    "summary": "The Protect LNG Act of 2025 aims to expedite the approval and operation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities. It addresses the impact of litigation on applications for LNG export authorizations, stipulating that lawsuits regarding environmental reviews under the Natural Gas Act and the National Environmental Policy Act will not invalidate issued permits, licenses, or approvals. Instead, the court will remand the matter to the relevant agency. The bill also establishes judicial review procedures for covered applications, including expedited review and a 90-day statute of limitations on claims.",
