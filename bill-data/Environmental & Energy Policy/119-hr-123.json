    "summary": "This bill, the \"Improving Science in Chemical Assessments Act,\" restructures how the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assesses chemical toxicity. It moves the responsibility for conducting chemical hazard and dose-response assessments from the EPA's centralized Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program to its various program offices (e.g., Office of Water, Office of Air). The act establishes specific scientific standards for these assessments, emphasizing transparency and the use of the best available science. It also creates a steering committee to coordinate these efforts, prevent duplication, and mandates a new database to house all chemical assessment data.",
