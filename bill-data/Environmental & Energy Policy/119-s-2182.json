    "summary": "The Community Solar Consumer Choice Act of 2025 aims to increase participation in community solar programs. It mandates the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to boost access to community solar for various groups, especially low- and moderate-income individuals. The bill provides technical and financial assistance to state, local, and tribal governments, leveraging National Laboratories for data dissemination.  It amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to define community solar programs and establish standards for utility offerings, including timelines for state implementation, and also addresses federal contracts for public utility services with modifications.",
