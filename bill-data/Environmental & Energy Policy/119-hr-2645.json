    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 2645, aims to increase congressional oversight of the Antiquities Act, the law allowing for the designation of national monuments. It proposes amendments that would limit the effective duration of newly established national monuments to either six months or the end of the current congressional session, whichever comes first. Furthermore, it restricts the reuse of land previously considered for a national monument if the initial designation expires or is rejected, imposing a 25-year waiting period.",
