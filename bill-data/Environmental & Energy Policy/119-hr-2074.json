    "summary": "The Protecting Our Water Energy Resources Act (POWER Act) aims to prohibit the breaching of federally operated dams under certain conditions. It restricts breaches if they increase carbon emissions, reduce navigability for commercial interests, raise product prices, or if the replacement energy source occupies significantly more land. The bill also prohibits the retirement of energy generation sources (specifically hydropower dams) if doing so would raise electricity rates or decrease energy reliability. The Secretary is required to replace baseload generation within 30 days of retirement. The bill mandates consultations with and studies by various governmental agencies. ",
