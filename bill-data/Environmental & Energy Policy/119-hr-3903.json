    "summary": "This bill, the Chugach Alaska Land Exchange Oil Spill Recovery Act of 2025, authorizes a land exchange between the Chugach Alaska Corporation and the U.S. government. It aims to resolve split ownership issues stemming from the Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup, where the government acquired surface rights while Chugach Alaska retained subsurface mineral rights. The exchange involves Chugach Alaska conveying subsurface rights in exchange for federal land, consolidating ownership for conservation purposes and facilitating more efficient land management.",
