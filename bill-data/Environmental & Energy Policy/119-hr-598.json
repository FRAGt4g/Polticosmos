    "summary": "The Forest Information Reform Act amends the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.  It addresses when the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior are *not* required to reinitiate consultation on land management or land use plans related to endangered species, specifically when new species are listed or critical habitats are designated or when new information reveals previously unconsidered effects. It essentially limits the scope of required reviews under the Endangered Species Act.",
