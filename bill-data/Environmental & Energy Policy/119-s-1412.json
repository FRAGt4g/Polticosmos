    "summary": "The Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act of 2025 aims to protect the cultural and historic resources within the Greater Chaco region in New Mexico, focusing on the area surrounding the Chaco Culture National Historical Park. The bill withdraws certain federal lands from various uses, including mineral leasing and mining, effectively preventing oil and gas development in the area.  It addresses the potential impacts of renewed oil exploration and development, and emphasizes the importance of consulting with tribal communities. The bill also specifies procedures for managing existing oil and gas leases and allows for possible land conveyance to Indigenous tribes.",
