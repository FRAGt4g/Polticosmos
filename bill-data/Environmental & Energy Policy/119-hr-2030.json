    "summary": "The Maintaining Cooperative Permitting Act of 2025 aims to solidify the authority of state permit programs for the discharge of dredged or fill material under Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. It prevents the Environmental Protection Agency from withdrawing approval of certain state programs (Michigan, New Jersey, and Florida), unless authorized by Congress. The bill also establishes a transition period for Florida's program and outlines a process for approving comparable state programs. It clarifies that approving a state permit program isn't a rule or regulation.",
