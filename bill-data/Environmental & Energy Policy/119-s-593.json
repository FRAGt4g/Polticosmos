    "summary": "The Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2025 amends the Clean Air Act. It modifies Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) requirements for gasoline and ethanol blends, allowing for greater flexibility and potentially expanding fuel choices. Additionally, the bill addresses the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) by providing for the return of certain retired credits to small refineries, particularly those related to compliance years 2016-2018. This aims to ease regulatory burdens for smaller fuel producers.",
