    "summary": "The Clean Shipping Act of 2025 aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from marine vessels. It mandates fuel carbon intensity standards for vessels on covered voyages, gradually decreasing over time, starting with a 30% reduction by 2030 and reaching 100% by 2050 relative to a 2027 baseline. The bill also includes in-port zero-emission standards by 2035, requiring the elimination of emissions from vessels at anchorage or berth within the contiguous United States. Both standards are subject to feasibility considerations.",
