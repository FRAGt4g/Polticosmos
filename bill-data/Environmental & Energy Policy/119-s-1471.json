    "summary": "The 'Climate Change Financial Risk Act of 2025' mandates the Federal Reserve to analyze climate change's financial risks. It requires the Fed to develop climate risk scenarios, in collaboration with climate scientists. The bill establishes a Technical Development Group to advise on these scenarios and assess risks. Nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies with significant assets will be subject to biennial tests to evaluate their ability to absorb financial losses under these scenarios. It also mandates a survey of financial institutions to assess their adaptation plans. The goal is to strengthen the financial system's resilience to climate-related shocks.",
