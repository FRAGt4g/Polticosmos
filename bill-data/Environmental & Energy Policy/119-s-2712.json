    "summary": "The 'America's Clean Future Fund Act' aims to combat climate change through a multi-pronged approach. It establishes the Climate Change Finance Corporation (C2FC) to fund clean energy projects, sets a carbon fee to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and creates the America's Clean Future Fund to distribute revenue towards rebates, agricultural decarbonization, and community transition assistance. The bill also includes border adjustments for carbon-intensive products and mandates studies on carbon pricing and sequestration targets.",
