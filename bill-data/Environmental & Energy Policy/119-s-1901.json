    "summary": "The Protect LNG Act of 2025 aims to expedite the approval and operation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities. It addresses the impact of legal challenges on existing permits and licenses, preventing them from being invalidated in court. Instead, the bill mandates that courts remand the matter to the relevant federal agency to resolve any violations.  It also specifies jurisdiction for judicial review, provides for expedited review, and sets a 90-day limit for filing legal challenges related to permit approvals, effectively limiting the ability to block LNG projects through litigation.",
