It mandates a wildfire risk assessment and mitigation plan for these areas and the adjacent Wild Rogue Wilderness. The bill also expands the Wild Rogue Wilderness area and withdraws specific federal lands in Curry and Josephine Counties from activities like mining and mineral leasing to protect natural resources. The act aims to conserve and enhance recreational values and environmental protection within these areas.",
