    "summary": "The Wildfire Resilient Communities Act aims to provide funding for hazardous fuels reduction projects on federal lands. The bill defines project priorities, focusing on areas near at-risk communities, high wildfire hazard zones, and areas in specific fire regimes. It mandates the transfer of $30 billion from the Treasury to agency heads for these projects. Additionally, the bill allocates funds for the community wildfire defense grant program and amends sections of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003, including the establishment of a County Stewardship Fund to distribute funds to counties based on contract receipts.",
