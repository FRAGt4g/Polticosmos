    "summary": "The Legacy Mine Cleanup Act of 2025 establishes the Office of Mountains, Deserts, and Plains within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This office will coordinate cleanup actions at abandoned mine sites, including those on tribal lands, and develop best practices, disseminate information, and coordinate with various stakeholders. It mandates the creation of a priority mine list and interagency plans for uranium contamination cleanup on the Navajo Nation. The bill aims to improve human health, environmental protection, and encourage coordination on remediation efforts without granting new regulatory authority.",
