    "summary": "The 'Protecting American Energy Production Act' (H.R. 26) seeks to secure hydraulic fracturing as a method for oil and natural gas production. It expresses the view that states should be the primary regulators of fracking on state and private lands. Critically, the bill prohibits the President from declaring a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing unless explicitly authorized by an Act of Congress. This action would limit the President's executive authority over energy policy and reinforce the power of Congress and individual states in regulating domestic energy production.",
