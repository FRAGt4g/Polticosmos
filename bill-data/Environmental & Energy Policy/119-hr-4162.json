    "summary": "The Community Solar Consumer Choice Act of 2025 aims to increase access to community solar programs. It mandates the Secretary of Energy to establish a program promoting community solar participation, especially for low-income individuals, businesses, and governments. The bill defines community solar facilities and programs, requiring utilities to offer such programs with equitable access. It also provides technical assistance and encourages leveraging existing federal programs. Additionally, the bill amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and modifies provisions related to federal public utility contracts.",
