    "summary": "This bill, the Facilitating Lower Atmospheric Released Emissions Act (FLARE Act), aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to incentivize the capture and utilization of natural gas that would otherwise be flared or vented. It proposes permanent full expensing for qualified property used in flaring and venting mitigation systems, which includes systems that collect and utilize methane and heavier hydrocarbons for various purposes. It excludes foreign entities of concern. The amendments apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2025.",
