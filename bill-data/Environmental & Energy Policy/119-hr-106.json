    "summary": "The Less Imprecision in Species Treatment (LIST) Act of 2025 amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to modify the delisting process. It requires the Secretary of the Interior to initiate delisting procedures when a species' recovery goals are met or if the species has otherwise recovered. The bill also establishes a new procedure to delist species if the original listing was based on inaccurate, fraudulent, or misrepresentative scientific data. Lastly, it expands the criteria to be considered during the mandatory 5-year review of a listed species, focusing on recovery goals and the validity of the original listing.",
