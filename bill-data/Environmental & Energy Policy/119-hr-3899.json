    "summary": "This bill, the Clarifying Federal General Permits Act, amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to clarify the process for general permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. It addresses the expiration of general permits, mandating the Administrator to provide notice in the Federal Register at least two years prior to expiration if a new permit won't be issued.  If notice isn't given, the expired permit's terms continue to apply.  The bill aims to provide clarity and continuity regarding pollutant discharge regulations.",
