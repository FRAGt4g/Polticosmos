    "summary": "The Baseload Reliability Protection Act aims to prevent the retirement or fuel source conversion of baseload electric generating units in areas with high or elevated risk of electricity supply shortfalls, as categorized by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. It amends the Federal Power Act to prohibit these actions and establishes a petition process for exemptions, considering factors like unprofitability and impact on the bulk-power system. The bill also specifies DOE grants and loans to keep units operational and mandates standardized risk assessment criteria by the Electric Reliability Organization. It also includes protection from penalties for operators complying with the prohibition.",
