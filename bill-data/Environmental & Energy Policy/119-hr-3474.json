    "summary": "The Federal Mechanical Insulation Act aims to clarify that the installation of mechanical insulation in federal buildings qualifies as an energy and water efficiency measure. It amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to include a definition of \"mechanical insulation property\" and mandates the inclusion of such installations in comprehensive energy and water evaluations of federal buildings. The bill seeks to reduce energy loss by promoting the use of specific insulation materials that meet or exceed the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers Standard 90.1.",
