    "summary": "The 'Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act of 2025' aims to amend the Clean Air Act to prevent the elimination of the sale of new motor vehicles with internal combustion engines. The bill restricts the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from granting waivers to states that implement standards limiting the sale or use of such vehicles. It also mandates the EPA to revoke existing waivers that do not comply with the new stipulations. The bill's main goal is to protect consumer choice and prevent a transition to electric vehicles by government mandate.",
