    "summary": "The \"TORCH Act\" aims to expedite forest management activities to reduce catastrophic wildfire risk. It streamlines environmental reviews by creating categorical exclusions for hazardous tree removal and vegetation management near power lines. The bill increases size limits for wildfire mitigation projects, expands authority for small timber sales, and promotes livestock grazing for fuel reduction. It also modifies the \"Good Neighbor Authority\" to better include Indian tribes and limits requirements to re-consult on land management plans under the Endangered Species Act when new species are listed.",
