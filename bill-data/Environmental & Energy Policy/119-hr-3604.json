The bill directs the Director of the National Park Service to establish a program for reducing and potentially eliminating the sale and distribution of these products. Regional directors are tasked with implementing the program, considering factors like costs, infrastructure, and visitor education. The bill mandates biennial evaluations of the program's effectiveness and defines key terms, including 'disposable plastic products'.",
