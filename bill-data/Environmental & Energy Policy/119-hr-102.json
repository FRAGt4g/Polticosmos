    "summary": "The American Sovereignty and Species Protection Act of 2025 (H.R. 102) amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973. It proposes two key changes: first, to prohibit the listing of any species not native to the United States as endangered or threatened. Second, it bans the use of U.S. financial assistance under the Act for acquiring land or water in foreign countries. The legislation aims to focus the scope and resources of the Endangered Species Act strictly within the borders of the United States.",
