    "summary": "This bill amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to change how animal populations are assessed. It mandates that artificially propagated animals (e.g., those bred in captivity) be treated the same as naturally propagated, wild animals for all determinations under the Act, including listing decisions. It also requires the Secretary to authorize the use of artificial propagation for any mitigation purposes required by the Act. These provisions would apply to all species, including those listed as endangered or threatened before this bill's enactment, potentially altering how species populations are counted and managed.",
