    "summary": "The Reducing Waste in National Parks Act aims to reduce disposable plastic products within the National Park System. It mandates the National Park Service (NPS) to establish a program, led by regional directors, to eliminate or curtail the sale and distribution of disposable plastic products, emphasizing water bottles. The bill outlines factors to consider during implementation, including costs, waste reduction, infrastructure, and contractual obligations. It also requires visitor education strategies and a biennial evaluation of the program's effectiveness, focusing on public response, visitor satisfaction, and environmental impact.",
