    "summary": "The \u201cShielding Students from Wildfire Smoke Act\u201d aims to improve understanding and policy responses to the impacts of wildfire smoke on children in educational and childcare settings. The bill mandates the Environmental Protection Agency to commission the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to review current school and childcare policies regarding wildfire smoke exposure. This review will assess existing standards, identify research and policy gaps, and provide recommendations to Congress to better protect children, especially those in under-resourced settings, during and after wildfire smoke events, including extracurricular activities.",
