    "summary": "The CHEFS Act proposes amending the Internal Revenue Code to offer tax credits to small restaurant businesses for the purchase and installation of qualified emissions control devices on cook stoves and char broilers. The credit amount varies from 10% to 35% of the total cost, increasing for businesses in eligible historical buildings. The bill also defines 'eligible small restaurant business,' 'qualified emissions control device,' and relevant equipment. It further classifies these devices as 3-year property.",
