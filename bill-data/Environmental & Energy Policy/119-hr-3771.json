    "summary": "This bill, the Protecting Coasts and Cities from Severe Weather Act, aims to improve coastal flooding and storm surge forecasting. It mandates the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere to establish a program focused on improving forecasting accuracy, incorporating new data sources like in-situ sensors, and developing probabilistic forecasts. The bill also addresses data gaps in vulnerable areas, requiring the identification of under-observed regions and the implementation of activities to improve weather observation coverage, impact-based decision support, and emergency information sharing, including pilot projects for infrastructure and emergency management.",
