    "summary": "The Aquatic Biodiversity Preservation Act of 2025 directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish and carry out a program to sequence the genomes of aquatic species. The program will identify and catalogue specimens, obtain genetic samples, sequence genomes, make data publicly available, and provide funding and assistance to participating entities. The bill also defines key terms like 'aquatic species of greatest conservation need' and 'covered entity,' and specifies data sharing and appropriation details. The Act aims to enhance scientific understanding, conservation, management, and enforcement efforts related to aquatic biodiversity and requires public data sharing within a year of sequencing completion, with exceptions for Tribal governments.",
