It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to allow evaluation and permit construction/operation of solar and wind energy facilities on these leased areas, provided the leaseholder consents. The bill also mandates the Secretary to determine if such actions qualify for categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act and to issue related rulemaking.",
