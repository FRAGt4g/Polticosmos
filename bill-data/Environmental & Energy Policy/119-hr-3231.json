    "summary": "The American Energy Act amends the Mineral Leasing Act to address permit processing for drilling, lease sale litigation, and permit terms. It clarifies that pending civil actions generally won't halt permit processing unless a court has vacated the lease. It limits permit validity to four years. It also restricts court actions that could limit oil and gas lease sales, requiring a showing of imminent environmental harm for intervention. Finally, it prevents courts from enjoining lease awards if bids have been opened or the high bidder disclosed.",
