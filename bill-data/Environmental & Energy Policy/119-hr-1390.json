    "summary": "The Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II modifies permitting requirements for the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant in San Diego. It allows the EPA Administrator to issue permits for discharges into marine waters, provided certain conditions are met, including maintaining the deep ocean outfall, limiting total suspended solids, requiring specific treatment levels, and mandating ocean monitoring. The bill also sets production goals for potable water reuse and defines key terms related to the plant and its operation.",
