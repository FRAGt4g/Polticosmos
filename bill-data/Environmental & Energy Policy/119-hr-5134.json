    "summary": "The Appalachian Trail Centennial Act aims to enhance the preservation, maintenance, and management of national historic and scenic trails. It focuses on cooperative management, designating operational partners for trails (like the Appalachian Trail Conservancy), addressing property rights, and establishing land and resource protection priority lists. The bill defines key terms, clarifies roles of the Federal government and volunteer organizations, and seeks to improve planning and development, including assessing economic impacts on gateway communities and increasing visitor capacity. It also authorizes appropriations for these efforts.",
