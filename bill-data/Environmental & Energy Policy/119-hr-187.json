    "summary": "The Modernizing Access to our Public Waters Act of 2025 (MAPWaters Act) directs federal land and water management agencies to standardize, digitize, and publish data on public recreational use of federal waterways. The bipartisan bill mandates the creation of a publicly accessible online database with geospatial information on waterway restrictions, access points like boat ramps, navigation details, and fishing regulations. It requires agencies to coordinate, develop common data standards, and regularly update the information, aiming to make it easier for the public to find and understand rules for recreation on federal waters.",
