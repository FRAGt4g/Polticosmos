    "summary": "This bill, the \"Methane Border Adjustment Mechanism Act,\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on imported petroleum and natural gas. The tax is calculated based on the methane emissions from the substance's country of origin, mirroring domestic methane regulations under the Clean Air Act. It aims to reduce global methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, and create a level playing field for U.S. producers. The bill also provides an alternative tax calculation for importers who can verify their specific supply chain emissions and encourages international cooperation to establish similar border adjustments and a global emissions tracking body.",
