    "summary": "The Harnessing Energy At Thermal Sources Act (HEATS Act) amends the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. It waives the requirement for a federal drilling permit for geothermal exploration and production on certain non-federal lands, provided the U.S. has a subsurface interest of less than 50% and the operator has a state permit.  The bill also exempts such activities from NEPA requirements, section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, and from requiring additional Federal action. It maintains existing royalty obligations and includes exceptions for Indian lands and resources. The Secretary can still conduct onsite reviews.",
