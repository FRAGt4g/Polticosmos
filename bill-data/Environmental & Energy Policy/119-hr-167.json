    "summary": "The Community Reclamation Partnerships Act of 2025 amends a 1977 law to clean up land and water polluted by coal mining before that year. The bill authorizes states to create memoranda of understanding with government agencies for mine drainage remediation. It also establishes 'Community Reclaimer Partnerships,' allowing states to partner with vetted, non-liable volunteer groups on reclamation projects. To encourage this, the bill shifts project liability from the volunteer group to the state, except in cases of gross negligence. The provisions of the act are set to expire in 2032.",
