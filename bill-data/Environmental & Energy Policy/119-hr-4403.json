    "summary": "The Clear Skies Act aims to prohibit weather modification activities within the United States and its territories. It imposes criminal and civil penalties for violations, mandates public reporting of suspected violations, and requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to investigate and refer confirmed violations to the Attorney General. The bill also repeals existing federal authorities that authorize or require weather modification, including regulations and executive orders.  Weather modification is defined broadly, encompassing activities like geoengineering and cloud seeding.",
