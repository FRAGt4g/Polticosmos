It focuses on sturgeon held in captivity or controlled environments, exempting certain activities related to them from specific sections of the Endangered Species Act. The bill outlines requirements for demonstrating and documenting the legal holding of sturgeon and their progeny, and specifies that these requirements should avoid duplicating existing regulations.",
