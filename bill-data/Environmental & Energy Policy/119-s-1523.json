It focuses on streamlining water research, integrating research into NOAA's unified forecast system, and clarifying the NWC's role in coordinating water research activities across various federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Army Corps of Engineers, and USGS. The bill also tasks the Under Secretary with overseeing the River Forecast Centers and administering the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology, while extending funding for the NWC through 2028.",
