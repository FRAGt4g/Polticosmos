    "summary": "The 'Stop NOAA Closures Act' imposes a moratorium on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) closing, suspending, leasing, constructing, consolidating, or limiting access to its facilities. This moratorium has two key provisions. A general moratorium is put in place, with exceptions for emergencies, and the moratorium ends 180 days after a report is submitted to Congress justifying the processes for facility changes. Future actions require a report to Congress 30 days prior. The bill aims to increase transparency and oversight.",
