    "summary": "The 'Stop California from Advancing Regulatory Burden Act of 2025' aims to amend the Clean Air Act. It seeks to eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) waiver allowing California to set its own, stricter emissions standards for vehicles and engines and prevent other states from adopting California's standards. The bill also prohibits states from implementing emissions standards for nonroad engines and vehicles, effectively limiting state authority on environmental regulations related to emissions.",
