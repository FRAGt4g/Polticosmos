    "summary": "This bill, the Weatherization Enhancement and Readiness Act of 2025, aims to reauthorize the Weatherization Assistance Program and establish a weatherization readiness program. It amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act, increasing the average cost per dwelling unit for weatherization, clarifying reweatherization limitations, and removing the renewable energy systems clause. The new readiness program provides grants to states and tribal organizations to prepare low-income homes for weatherization, addressing structural issues and environmental hazards. It also authorizes appropriations for the program.",
