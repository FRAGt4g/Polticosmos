It mandates that the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) publish an annual report. This report will detail legal challenges related to NEPA compliance, including the agencies involved and outcomes. It also requires the report to include metrics on the length of environmental reviews, their costs, and timelines, as well as a list of categorical exclusions used by federal agencies. The data collected will be disaggregated by project type and various sectors.",
