    "summary": "The Accurately Counting Risk Elimination Solutions (ACRES) Act requires the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to submit annual, publicly available reports on hazardous fuels reduction activities on federal lands. These reports must accurately count treated acreage, detail costs, locations (including the wildland-urban interface), risk levels, and effectiveness. The bill mandates the creation of standardized data-tracking procedures to improve reporting accuracy and transparency. It also directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the act's implementation. The bill does not authorize additional funding for these activities.",
