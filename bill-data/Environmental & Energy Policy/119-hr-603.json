    "summary": "This bill, the Reinforcing the Grid Against Extreme Weather Act of 2025, directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to improve interregional electricity transfer capabilities. It mandates the creation of regulations to assess existing transfer capabilities between transmission planning regions, determine minimum transfer capabilities to ensure reliability, identify and allocate costs for transmission projects, and prevent disclosure of cybersecurity information. The bill also requires transmission planning entities to file and receive approval for plans outlining how they will achieve these goals. The bill defines key terms like 'greenhouse gas' and 'transmission benefit.'",
