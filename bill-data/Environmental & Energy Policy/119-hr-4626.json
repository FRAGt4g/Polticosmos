    "summary": "The \"Don't Mess With My Home Appliances Act\" aims to limit the Department of Energy's (DOE) ability to set or change energy conservation standards for home appliances. It restricts the Secretary of Energy from enacting standards that aren't technologically feasible, economically justified, or don't result in significant energy/water savings. The bill also introduces new requirements for the DOE including public disclosure, economic impact analyses, and regulatory review after 2 years. Also, the bill prevents new or revised standards for distribution transformers. This bill appears to be a check on regulatory power regarding home appliance energy efficiency.",
