    "summary": "This bill, the 'Historic Roadways Protection Act,' prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from using federal funds to finalize or implement certain travel management plans in designated areas of Utah. This funding ban is temporary, lasting until numerous specified court cases concerning historical R.S. 2477 road rights-of-way between Utah counties and the United States are fully adjudicated. The act essentially pauses federal action on road management in specific Bureau of Land Management areas while these legal claims over historical routes are resolved.",
