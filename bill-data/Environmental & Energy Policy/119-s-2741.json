    "summary": "The Legacy Mine Cleanup Act of 2025 establishes the Office of Mountains, Deserts, and Plains within the Environmental Protection Agency to facilitate and coordinate cleanup actions at abandoned hardrock mine sites. The bill defines key terms, outlines the office's purposes (coordination, best practices, contracting for small businesses), and details duties such as prioritizing mine sites for cleanup, process improvement, interagency plans for uranium contamination on the Navajo Nation, and providing technical assistance. The act emphasizes existing EPA authorities and does not introduce new regulatory powers or default cleanup standards.",
