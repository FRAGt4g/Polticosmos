    "summary": "H.R. 676 proposes to exempt certain federal actions related to energy and mineral activities on specific federal lands from the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requirements. This exemption would apply to the issuance, granting, or renewal of leases, easements, and rights-of-way under the Mineral Leasing Act for oil, gas, and coal exploration and production. It would also cover permits and authorizations under the Mining Law of 1872 for critical mineral extraction on open lands.",
