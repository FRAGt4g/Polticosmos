    "summary": "The American Seabed Protection Act aims to prohibit certain mining activities on the deep seabed and Outer Continental Shelf. It finds that deep seabed mining poses significant environmental risks and calls for a comprehensive study of the environmental impacts of such activities. The bill prohibits issuing licenses or permits for exploration or commercial recovery in these areas, with an exception for scientific research. It mandates a study by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to assess environmental impacts, including effects on ecosystems, species, greenhouse gas emissions, and alternative mineral sources.",
