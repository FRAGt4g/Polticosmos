    "summary": "The Border Water Quality Restoration and Protection Act focuses on improving water quality in the Tijuana River and New River watersheds, which cross the U.S.-Mexico border. It establishes programs, allocates funds, and outlines activities for pollution prevention, restoration, and infrastructure improvements. The bill mandates the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish and oversee programs, develop action plans, and provide grants. It also addresses the role of the International Boundary and Water Commission and the Secretary of State in managing projects and agreements with Mexico to address transboundary water issues, and seeks to coordinate with federal, state, and local agencies to restore water quality in and around the US-Mexico border.",
