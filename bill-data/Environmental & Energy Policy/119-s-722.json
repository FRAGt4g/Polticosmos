    "summary": "The Bureau of Land Management Mineral Spacing Act aims to streamline the oil and gas permitting process. It limits the Secretary of the Interior's permitting authority for drilling units where the federal government owns less than 50% of the minerals and doesn't own the surface estate, or in specific well scenarios. It mandates notification to the Secretary about state permits. It also amends the Mineral Leasing Act to limit the Secretary's authority on non-federal land in these units, particularly regarding bonds, land entry, mitigation, and surface reclamation approval.",
