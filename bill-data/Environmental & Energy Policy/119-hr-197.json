    "summary": "This bill authorizes a land exchange within Minnesota's Chippewa National Forest. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to convey approximately 17.5 acres of federal land to Big Winnie Land and Timber, LLC (BWLT). In return, the United States will acquire approximately 36.7 acres of non-federal land from BWLT, which will be incorporated into the National Forest. The exchange is contingent upon equal value appraisals, an environmental assessment, and other conditions. BWLT is responsible for covering all closing costs, surveys, and any cash equalization payment required if the federal land is valued higher.",
