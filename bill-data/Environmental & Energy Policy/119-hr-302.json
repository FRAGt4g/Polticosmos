    "summary": "The Water Rights Protection Act of 2025 prohibits the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture from conditioning federal permits, leases, or land use agreements on the transfer of private or state-recognized water rights to the U.S. government. The bill affirms the authority of states to allocate, regulate, and adjudicate water use. It requires federal agencies to coordinate with states to ensure federal actions are consistent with state water laws and do not impose greater restrictions. The act clarifies that it does not alter existing laws such as the Endangered Species Act or various established water rights.",
