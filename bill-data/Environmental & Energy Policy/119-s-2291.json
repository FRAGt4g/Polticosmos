    "summary": "The Flex Fuel Fairness Act of 2025 mandates the EPA to revise regulations to allow automakers to use a 31% lower gram per mile CO2 value for flexible fuel vehicles when calculating fleet average CO2 standards. This is based on the Argonne National Laboratory's GREET model, which suggests E85 fuel reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The Administrator can apply a larger reduction based on updated GREET model versions.",
