    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 408, aims to nullify two Presidential Memoranda issued on January 6, 2025. These memoranda withdrew specific areas of the United States Outer Continental Shelf\u2014including regions in the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Pacific, and the Northern Bering Sea\u2014from future oil and natural gas leasing. By declaring these memoranda to have 'no force or effect,' the legislation seeks to reverse the executive action and potentially make these offshore areas available again for oil and gas exploration and development. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.",
