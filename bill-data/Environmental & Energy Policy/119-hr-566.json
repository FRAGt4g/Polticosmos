    "summary": "The Cleaner Air Spaces Act of 2025 directs the EPA Administrator to provide grants to air pollution control agencies to implement programs combating wildfire smoke. These programs involve establishing clean air centers, distributing air filtration units to low-income households at risk, providing educational materials, and conducting surveys. The bill defines key terms like 'clean air center' and 'covered household' and outlines program requirements, including partnerships with community-based organizations. The Administrator is required to submit a report to Congress evaluating the program's effectiveness. The bill authorizes appropriations of $30 million for the program over three fiscal years.",
