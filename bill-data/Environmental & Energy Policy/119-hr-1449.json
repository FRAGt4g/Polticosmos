    "summary": "The Energy Resilient Communities Act aims to improve energy resilience, energy democracy, and security of communities by establishing a grant program. The Secretary of Energy will provide grants to eligible entities for technical assistance (e.g., upgrading building codes, developing hazard mitigation plans), community outreach, and the development/construction of clean energy microgrids. Priority is given to projects benefiting environmental justice communities and community-owned systems. The act includes provisions for educational outreach, cost-sharing, and requirements for American-made goods, prevailing wages, and project labor. Funding is authorized for fiscal years 2025-2034.",
