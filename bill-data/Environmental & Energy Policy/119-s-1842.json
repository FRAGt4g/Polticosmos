    "summary": "The Wildfire Reduction and Carbon Removal Act of 2025 proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code to create a tax credit for carbon removal and storage using forest residues from wildfire management activities. The credit amount varies depending on the storage method (geological storage or long-duration utilization). It also outlines specific regulations for sustainability standards, lifecycle analysis, monitoring, reporting, and verification to ensure accurate measurement and accountability regarding qualified carbon dioxide equivalent removal. Furthermore, it details how the credit can be combined with other federal programs.",
