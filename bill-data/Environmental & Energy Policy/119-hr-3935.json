    "summary": "The Reducing Permitting Uncertainty Act amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to clarify the timeframe during which the Administrator can prohibit the specification of disposal sites for dredged or fill material. It aims to reduce permitting uncertainty by linking the prohibition period to the permit application process, starting when an applicant submits all required information and ending when the Secretary issues the permit. The bill focuses on streamlining environmental permitting processes.",
