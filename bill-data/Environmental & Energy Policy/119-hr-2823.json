    "summary": "This bill, the Climate Change Financial Risk Act of 2025, mandates the Federal Reserve to assess climate-related financial risks. It requires the Board of Governors to develop climate change risk scenarios, establish a Technical Development Group, and conduct biennial analyses of covered entities to evaluate their ability to withstand financial losses under these scenarios. It also mandates a survey of financial institutions to assess their climate risk preparedness and adaptation plans. The goal is to strengthen the financial system against climate-related risks.",
