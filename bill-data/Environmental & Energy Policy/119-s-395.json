    "summary": "The Emergency Fuel Reduction Act of 2025 aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on high-risk federal land. The bill amends the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 to allow for categorical exclusions from National Environmental Policy Act requirements for specific fuel reduction projects. These projects involve removing hazardous fuels, such as dead or insect-infected trees, to protect communities, infrastructure, and threatened/endangered species habitats. The bill specifies limitations, such as not applying to wilderness areas or land where vegetation removal is prohibited.",
