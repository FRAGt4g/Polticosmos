    "summary": "This bill, the Federal Lands and Waters Leasing Transparency Act, amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Mineral Leasing Act. It mandates the Secretary of the Interior to provide reports explaining the basis for rejecting oil and gas lease bids when the fair market value isn't met. It clarifies that court orders cannot prevent lease issuance within a 60-day deadline, unless a law violation is found. Furthermore, it limits the impact of legal challenges to offshore lease sales, preventing delays to related activities even if a court finds non-compliance.",
