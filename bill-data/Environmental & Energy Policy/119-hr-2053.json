    "summary": "The 'Stop Giving Big Oil Free Money Act' aims to prevent the Secretary of the Interior from issuing new oil or natural gas production leases in the Gulf of Mexico to companies that don't renegotiate existing leases. The renegotiation would require royalty payments if oil and gas prices exceed specified thresholds. The bill also allows existing leases from 1996-2000 to be amended to incorporate price thresholds for royalty suspension provisions. The bill's ultimate goal is to increase royalty payments to the government when oil and gas prices are high.",
