    "summary": "The 'Stop Ineffective Paper Straws Act' (SIPS Act) aims to mandate that federal agencies only procure or use straws with the strength and durability of plastic straws. It prohibits contractors from promoting or providing paper straws and requires them to supply durable straws. The bill defines 'covered agencies' including the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Defense, and others. The primary goal is to ensure the functional and durable straw use within these agencies.",
