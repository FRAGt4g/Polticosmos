    "summary": "This bill, the \"Polluters Pay Climate Fund Act of 2025,\" aims to address climate change by imposing a tax on fossil fuel emissions, with funds directed towards a newly established \"Polluters Pay Climate Fund.\" The fund will finance climate resilience, adaptation efforts, disaster response, and environmental justice initiatives. The bill defines assessable persons (fossil fuel extractors/refiners), establishes a payment structure, provides for installment payments, and sets aside 40% of the funds for environmental justice communities. It also clarifies that the Act does not relieve entities from existing liabilities.",
