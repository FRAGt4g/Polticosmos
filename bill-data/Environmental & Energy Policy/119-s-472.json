    "summary": "This bill, the Ski Hill Resources for Economic Development Act, amends the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 to establish a Ski Area Fee Retention Account. This account would receive revenue from ski area permit rental charges collected by the Secretary of Agriculture. These funds would be used for various activities related to the Forest Service ski area program, including administration, staff training, visitor services, and infrastructure improvements, as well as wildfire planning and response. Funds are distributed between local units and agency-wide activities, with stipulations on expenditure types and limitations on land acquisition and wildfire suppression. The law takes effect 60 days after enactment.",
