    "summary": "The Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act (H.R. 346) amends the Clean Air Act to prevent states from banning or limiting the sale of new vehicles with internal combustion engines. The bill prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from granting waivers for state-level emission standards that would directly or indirectly phase out gasoline-powered cars. It also mandates the revocation of any such waivers granted since January 1, 2022. The legislation aims to counteract state-led efforts, like those in California, to transition entirely to zero-emission vehicles, framing the issue as a matter of consumer choice.",
