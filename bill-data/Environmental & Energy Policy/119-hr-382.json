    "summary": "The \"Exported Carbon Emissions Report Act of 2025\" (H.R. 382) directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to annually collect, calculate, and publish data on greenhouse gas emissions. The report must compare total domestic emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from fossil fuels with the emissions released outside the U.S. that result from exported American fossil fuels. The EPA is required to use the best available science, consult with the Energy Information Administration and International Energy Agency, and make the findings publicly available. This aims to create transparency regarding the full climate impact of U.S. fossil fuel production and trade.",
