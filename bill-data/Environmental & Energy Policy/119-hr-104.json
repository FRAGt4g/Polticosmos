    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 104, titled the \"Protecting Arizona from Federal Land Grabs Act,\" seeks to amend U.S. law to require congressional approval for the creation or expansion of national monuments in Arizona. Introduced by Representative Biggs, the legislation would strip the President of the authority to unilaterally designate monuments in the state under the Antiquities Act. Instead, any such designation would need an express act of Congress, applying the same restriction that currently exists for Wyoming to Arizona. The bill aims to shift power over federal land designation from the executive branch to the legislative branch for the state of Arizona.",
