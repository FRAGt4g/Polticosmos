    "summary": "The Electronic Permitting Modernization Act aims to modernize permitting systems within the Department of the Interior. It mandates the creation of electronic systems for permit applications, processing, and record-keeping, as well as a public online repository for accessing permit information. The bill also requires the Secretary of the Interior to consult with stakeholders, prohibits disclosure of sensitive information, and ensures the new systems align with existing environmental policy. Periodic updates on implementation must be provided to relevant congressional committees.",
