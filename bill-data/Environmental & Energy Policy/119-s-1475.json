    "summary": "The Clean Cloud Act of 2025 aims to address the growing energy consumption of data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities. It mandates annual data collection on electricity consumption and energy sources used by these facilities. The bill introduces emissions performance standards, setting baselines for greenhouse gas emissions and imposing fees on utilities and facilities exceeding those baselines. Funds collected will be allocated to programs supporting consumer energy costs and promoting zero-carbon energy generation and storage, with a clawback provision for non-compliance. ",
