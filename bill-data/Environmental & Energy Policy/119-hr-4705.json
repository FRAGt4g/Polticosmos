    "summary": "The Appalachian Communities Health Equity Act of 2025 (ACHE Act) addresses health concerns linked to mountaintop removal coal mining. The bill mandates a health study by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to assess health impacts on nearby communities. It places a moratorium on new or renewed federal authorizations for mountaintop removal coal mining until the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines whether health risks exist. It also requires monitoring of ongoing mining projects and imposes a one-time fee on mining operators to cover the costs of the study and monitoring.",
