    "summary": "The Ejiao Act of 2025 aims to prohibit the import, export, transportation, sale, and purchase of donkeys, donkey hides, and products containing ejiao (a gelatin made from donkey skins) in the United States. This is due to concerns about the decimation of global donkey populations and the cruelty involved in the ejiao trade. The bill outlines penalties, sanctions, and forfeiture provisions for violations, and assigns enforcement to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Secretary of the Interior.",
