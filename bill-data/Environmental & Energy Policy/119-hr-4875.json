    "summary": "The Coal Ash for American Infrastructure Act amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to establish a framework for the beneficial use of coal combustion residuals (coal ash). It allows owners/operators of coal combustion residuals units to apply for designation as \u201cbeneficial use staging units.\u201d These units must meet certain environmental standards (lining, groundwater monitoring, compliance with regulations) and commit to removing a percentage of the coal ash for beneficial use within a specified timeframe. The bill also includes reporting requirements and preempts state laws that conflict with its provisions.",
