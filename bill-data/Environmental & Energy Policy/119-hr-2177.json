    "summary": "The Tradeable Energy Performance Standards Act amends the Clean Air Act to establish a market-based system for reducing emissions from large electricity generators and thermal energy users. It introduces tradeable emission allowances, sets output-based emission targets, and allows for alternative compliance payments. The bill outlines definitions, emission allowance distribution, trading mechanisms, and penalties for non-compliance. It also includes provisions for an offset program to fund projects that avoid emissions or sequester carbon dioxide, and requires regular reports from the Comptroller General.",
