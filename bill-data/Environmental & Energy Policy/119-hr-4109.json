    "summary": "The Recycling and Composting Accountability Act mandates the EPA Administrator to improve recycling and composting programs. It requires reports on infrastructure capabilities, including materials recovery facilities, and information gathering on recycling and composting systems. The bill also directs the Administrator to create recycling rate estimates, update reports on end markets for recyclable and compostable materials, study the diversion of recyclable materials from the circular market, and authorize appropriations for these activities. Additionally, it addresses federal agency recycling efforts and prohibits unfunded mandates.",
