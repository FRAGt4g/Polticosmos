    "summary": "This bill, the Confidence in Clean Water Permits Act, amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to clarify the scope of permits and compliance requirements for pollutant discharges. It specifies that compliance with permit conditions constitutes compliance for pollutants with effluent limitations and for those identified in the permit, application process, or waste streams. Additionally, it modifies how water quality-based effluent limitations are expressed in permits, requiring specific descriptions of compliance methods, including numerical limits or narrative actions.",
