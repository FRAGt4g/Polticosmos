    "summary": "The Geothermal Energy Opportunity Act (H.R. 301) amends the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to accelerate the approval process for geothermal energy projects. It mandates that the Secretary must approve or deny applications for permits, rights-of-way, and other authorizations within 60 days after all legal and environmental reviews are complete. This deadline applies even when a civil lawsuit is pending, unless a federal court specifically issues an injunction or vacates the authorization. The bill aims to prevent litigation from being used as a tactic to stall geothermal projects and promote renewable energy development.",
