    "summary": "The 'Unlocking Domestic LNG Potential Act of 2025' amends the Natural Gas Act to grant the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) exclusive authority to approve or deny applications for LNG export/import facilities.  It streamlines the approval process and effectively declares such activities in the public interest.  The bill also clarifies the President's authority to prohibit imports/exports under certain circumstances, particularly involving countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism. It primarily focuses on deregulation and the expansion of the natural gas industry.",
