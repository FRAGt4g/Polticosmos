    "summary": "The 'No Net Gain in Federal Lands Act of 2025' mandates that the federal government's acquisition of land, water, and related interests in a state during a fiscal year cannot exceed its disposal of such assets in that same state. The bill requires annual inventories and reports detailing federal land holdings, categorized by interest type and agency, to Congress and the President. If acquisitions surpass disposals, the President must convey sufficient federal land to the state to achieve compliance. Land held by tribes or acquired through specific legal means is excluded. The bill aims to limit federal land ownership growth.",
