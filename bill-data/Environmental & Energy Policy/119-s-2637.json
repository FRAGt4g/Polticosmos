It mandates the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior, in coordination with other federal agencies, to develop interagency standards for geospatial data, digitize and make publicly available online data on waterway restrictions, access, and fishing regulations. The bill emphasizes data updates, public comment, and cooperation with various partners. It also requires annual reports on progress and clarifies that the Act does not alter existing jurisdictional authorities.",
