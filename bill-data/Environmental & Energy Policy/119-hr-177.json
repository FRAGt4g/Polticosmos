    "summary": "This bill, the \"Yosemite National Park Equal Access and Fairness Act,\" seeks to expand public recreational access to the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and Lake Eleanor Basin areas. It would authorize activities such as swimming, non-motorized boating, and camping. The legislation also amends the 1913 Act by significantly increasing the annual fee paid by the City of San Francisco from $30,000 to $2,000,000, indexed to inflation, to fund maintenance and wildfire mitigation. It further requires the Secretary of the Interior to report on strategies for ensuring equitable public access and managing the associated costs.",
