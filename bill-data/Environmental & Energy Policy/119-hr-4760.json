    "summary": "The 'Cutting LNG Bunkering Red Tape Act' (HR 4760) amends the Natural Gas Act to clarify the definition of natural gas bunkering (supplying natural gas as fuel to ships). The bill specifies that bunkering is NOT considered an export unless the transfer happens in the territorial sea or inland waters of a foreign country, regardless of the vessels' flags. This aims to streamline the process of using LNG (liquefied natural gas) as marine fuel.",
