    "summary": "The Clean Water SRF Parity Act of 2025 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to expand eligibility for financial assistance from State water pollution control revolving funds (SRFs). It allows funding for qualified nonprofit entities constructing, acquiring, or improving treatment works. It also provides financial assistance to owners/operators of privately owned treatment works for various improvements, capacity reduction, energy efficiency measures, and security enhancements. The act specifies limitations to ensure benefits accrue to those served, not solely the owners.",
