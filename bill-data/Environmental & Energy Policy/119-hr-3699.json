    "summary": "The Energy Choice Act (H.R. 3699) prohibits states and local governments from restricting energy services based on the energy source (e.g., natural gas, renewable sources, electricity) used. It prevents regulations that limit the connection, modification, or distribution of energy services due to the type of energy involved, ensuring all energy sources have equal access to the market. The bill defines \"energy\" to include a broad range of fuels and electricity.",
