    "summary": "The 'No Radioactive Roads Act of 2025' directs the EPA to revise regulations regarding the use of phosphogypsum, a byproduct of fertilizer production. The bill mandates that any proposed use of phosphogypsum not already approved must undergo a case-by-case review, provide detailed exposure mitigation plans, and include thorough groundwater and surface water monitoring. The bill sets a maximum individual lifetime cancer risk threshold and requires making all relevant information publicly available. The bill aims to protect public health and the environment by limiting exposure to radioactive materials present in phosphogypsum.",
