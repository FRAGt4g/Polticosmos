    "summary": "The Enhancing Safety for Animals Act of 2025 aims to remove the Mexican wolf from the lists of threatened and endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The bill cites concerns about the wolf's impact on livestock, public safety, and recreational opportunities, highlighting perceived failures in conservation efforts and the impact on farmers and ranchers. It also seeks to nullify specific Fish and Wildlife Service rules related to the Mexican wolf and restrict the consideration of Mexican wolf recovery in Mexico when determining the wolf's status in the US.",
