    "summary": "The 'Financing Lead Out of Water Act of 2025' amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify private business use requirements for bonds used in lead service line replacement projects. The bill clarifies that qualified lead service line replacement use does not constitute private business use, allowing public water systems to use bond proceeds to replace privately-owned portions of lead service lines to comply with drinking water regulations. This change applies to obligations issued after December 31, 2025.",
