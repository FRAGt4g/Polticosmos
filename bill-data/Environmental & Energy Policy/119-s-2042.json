    "summary": "The Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2025 aims to provide lasting protection for inventoried roadless areas within the National Forest System. The bill finds that these areas offer crucial ecological and social values including healthy watersheds, biodiversity, recreation opportunities, and benefits to water filtration costs. The bill mandates that the Secretary of Agriculture shall not allow road construction, reconstruction, or logging in an inventoried roadless area where the Roadless Rule prohibits such activities, emphasizing multiple-use management.",
