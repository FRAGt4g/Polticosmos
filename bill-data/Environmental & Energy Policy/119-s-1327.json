    "summary": "The Advancing Grid-Enhancing Technologies Act of 2025 aims to incentivize the deployment of grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) to improve the efficiency and capacity of the electric grid. It mandates the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish a shared savings incentive, returning a portion of savings from GET investments to developers. The bill also requires annual congestion reporting from transmission operators and directs the Secretary of Energy to create an application guide and provide technical assistance to promote GET implementation and is authorized for appropriations.  It promotes improved situational awareness and control of the electric grid.",
