It also requires a consumer-visible label regarding filter maintenance. Furthermore, the bill directs the Administrator of the EPA to conduct a nationwide study on the presence, impact, and pathways of microfibers in the environment and human health, including a report to Congress within a year. Civil penalties are outlined for violations.",
