    "summary": "The Weatherization Resilience and Adaptation Program Act aims to establish a grant program to assist low-income individuals in adapting their homes and property to the impacts of climate change. The Secretary of the Interior will award grants to eligible program participants (states, tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations) who will then distribute funds to eligible property owners for resilience and adaptation activities. The bill defines key terms, sets application guidelines, specifies how funds can be used, and requires the development of resilience and adaptation standards.",
