    "summary": "The \"Don't Feed the Bears Act of 2025\" aims to prohibit the intentional feeding of bears on federal public lands. The bill finds that bear baiting, the practice of using food to attract bears for hunting, leads to increased bear populations, dangerous interactions with humans, and property damage. The legislation mandates the enforcement of existing regulations against bear feeding and requires the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture to implement new regulations prohibiting bear baiting on relevant public lands with exceptions for welfare, safety, or research.",
