    "summary": "This bill, the \"Limiting Incredulous Zealots Against Restricting Drilling Act of 2025\" (LIZARD Act of 2025), aims to remove the dunes sagebrush lizard from the lists of threatened and endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. It amends the Act to specifically exclude the dunes sagebrush lizard from its protections, preventing the Secretary from designating it as threatened or endangered. The bill appears to be related to oil & gas development and reducing environmental regulations.",
