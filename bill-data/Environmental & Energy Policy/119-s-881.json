    "summary": "The Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act amends the Clean Air Act to include fuel for ocean-going vessels as a source of renewable fuel for which credits can be generated under the renewable fuel program. The bill, introduced by Senator Ricketts and Senator Klobuchar, modifies the definition of renewable fuel to include fuel used in ocean-going vessels, aligning it with home heating oil and jet fuel. It mandates the EPA to create regulations within a year of enactment and report to Congress on the amendment's implementation.",
