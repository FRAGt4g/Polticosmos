    "summary": "The Judicial Review Timeline Clarity Act amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to clarify the timeframe for judicial review of permits related to the discharge of dredged or fill material. It establishes a 60-day statute of limitations for challenging individual or general permits and verifications, sets requirements for who can bring a lawsuit, and outlines court remedies, including limitations on vacating permits unless an imminent danger exists. The bill also mandates a timeframe for the Secretary or the State to respond to court remands.",
