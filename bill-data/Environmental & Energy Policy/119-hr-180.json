    "summary": "This bill amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to enhance transparency and reform litigation. It requires the government to publish online the scientific data used for species listings and share it with affected states beforehand. The bill mandates consideration of data from state, tribal, and local governments. It also directs the creation of a public, searchable database detailing federal expenditures on ESA-related lawsuits, including attorney's fees. Finally, it aligns the awarding of litigation costs with the 'prevailing party' standard under existing federal law, a change from the current ESA provision.",
