    "summary": "The Reliable Grid Act aims to prevent the EPA from enforcing regulations that restrict the operation of dispatchable electric generating units, primarily fossil fuel-fired units. The bill emphasizes the importance of reliable and affordable electricity and expresses concerns about the premature retirement of such units due to environmental regulations. It calls for the EPA to prioritize grid reliability, potentially providing waivers, and mandates the halting of certain regulations from the former administrator to ensure sufficient capacity. The bill references a reliability assessment from NERC and defines key terms related to the electricity grid.",
