    "summary": "This bill, introduced in the Senate, aims to allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to extend the deadline for licensees to begin construction on certain hydropower projects. It defines \"covered projects\" as those licensed before March 13, 2020.  If a licensee requests an extension, FERC can grant up to six additional years, broken down into not more than three two-year periods.  The bill also allows for the reinstatement of licenses that expired after December 31, 2023, and before the bill's enactment.",
