    "summary": "This bill, the \"New Source Review Permitting Improvement Act,\" amends the Clean Air Act to streamline the permitting process for industrial facilities. It redefines a \"modification\" that would trigger a review, tying it to an increase in the maximum hourly emission rate over a 10-year lookback period. The bill exempts projects that improve efficiency, safety, or reliability from this definition, unless the EPA finds they would adversely affect health or the environment. It also clarifies that for certain programs, changes are exempt if they don't result in a significant increase in annual actual emissions.",
