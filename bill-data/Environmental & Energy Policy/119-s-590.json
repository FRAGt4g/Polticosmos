    "summary": "The 'Improving Flood and Agricultural Forecasts Act of 2025' aims to improve weather forecasting, particularly for floods and agricultural purposes. It mandates the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere to maintain the National Mesonet Program. The program will gather environmental data from various sources (commercial, academic, etc.) to enhance understanding of weather events, forecast capabilities, and coordination across sectors. The bill authorizes appropriations for financial and technical assistance to build, expand, or upgrade mesonet systems, and requires regular briefings to Congress on the program's progress.",
