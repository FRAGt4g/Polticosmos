It mandates the EPA to develop a protocol for assessing and addressing cumulative public health risks from pollution and climate change, identify communities overburdened by environmental violations, analyze the causes of these violations, and implement measures to reduce them. It also defines key terms such as 'environmental justice community' and 'low-income community'.",
