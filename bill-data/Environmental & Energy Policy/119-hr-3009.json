    "summary": "The Trees for Residential Energy and Economic Savings Act of 2025 (TREES Act) directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a grant program to fund tree planting projects aimed at reducing residential energy consumption. The program will prioritize projects that maximize energy savings, target areas with high energy burdens, low tree canopy cover, and vulnerable populations. Grants cover project costs including planning, tree purchase, planting, maintenance, and training. The bill authorizes $50 million annually from 2026-2030 and sets a goal of planting at least 300,000 trees yearly.",
