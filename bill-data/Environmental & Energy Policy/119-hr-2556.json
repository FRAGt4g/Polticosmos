    "summary": "The Comprehensive Offshore Resource Enhancement Act of 2025 (CORE Act of 2025) focuses on enhancing national security and energy independence through offshore energy resource assessment. It mandates a report on transboundary hydrocarbon reservoirs, including an analysis of legal frameworks and recommendations for cooperation with neighboring countries. The bill also revises energy policy to standardize reports on undiscovered resources, their economic impact, and the effects of land withdrawals. Furthermore, it requires a comparative analysis of offshore production practices of major producing countries.",
