    "summary": "The Co-Location Energy Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to allow renewable energy projects (solar or wind) on existing federal energy lease areas. It allows for evaluations of these areas and the issuance of permits for construction and operation of renewable energy facilities, contingent on the consent of the original leaseholder. The bill also mandates the Secretary to determine if such actions qualify for categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act and to issue a rule to implement the section.",
