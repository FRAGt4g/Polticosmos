    "summary": "The 'Trust the Science Act' (H.R. 130) directs the Secretary of the Interior to remove the gray wolf from the federal list of endangered and threatened wildlife. The bill mandates that within 60 days of enactment, the Secretary must reissue a specific final rule from November 2020 that originally delisted the species. A key provision of the legislation explicitly states that the reissuance of this rule cannot be challenged in court, making the action exempt from judicial review. This effectively bypasses the usual regulatory and legal processes for species management under the Endangered Species Act.",
