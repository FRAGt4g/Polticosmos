    "summary": "The 'Uranium for Energy Independence Act of 2025' aims to include uranium on the list of critical minerals.  The bill mandates that uranium be considered a critical mineral, retroactively included in the 2022 list published by the United States Geological Survey, and included in all subsequent lists under the Energy Act of 2020. This change is intended to address the exclusion of fuel minerals from the definition of critical minerals, promoting uranium's role in energy independence.",
