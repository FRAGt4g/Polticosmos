    "summary": "This bill, the 'SHARKED Act of 2025,' directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a task force to address shark depredation\u2014when sharks damage fishing gear or take catches. Comprised of fishery managers, state agency representatives, and scientific experts, the task force will improve coordination, identify research priorities like non-lethal deterrents and shark behavior, and develop management strategies. It will also create educational materials for the fishing community and report its findings to Congress. The bill amends the Magnuson-Stevens Act to authorize research projects focused on better understanding and addressing shark depredation.",
