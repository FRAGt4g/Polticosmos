    "summary": "The Offshore Lands Authorities Act of 2025 aims to limit the President's authority to withdraw unleased offshore lands from mineral leasing. The bill nullifies several existing Presidential withdrawals, primarily impacting areas in the Arctic, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico. It sets limits on the size, duration, and cumulative acreage of future withdrawals, mandates assessments by the Secretary of the Interior, and establishes a Congressional disapproval procedure for presidential actions. The bill also prevents withdrawals that conflict with scheduled oil and gas lease sales.",
