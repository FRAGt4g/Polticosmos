    "summary": "The 'Defending our Dams Act' (H.R. 2073) aims to prevent the use of federal funds for breaching or altering the Lower Snake River dams in Washington State. It prohibits federal funds from being used to allow, lead to, or study any such actions, including studies on replacement of power, flood control, or navigation, or providing technical assistance for dam removal. The bill also restricts spillage operations at these dams, requiring approval from the Secretary of the Army and the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration, considering Columbia River System operations.",
