    "summary": "The Aviation Noise and Emissions Mitigation Act aims to address aircraft and airport-related noise and emissions. It establishes pilot grant programs through the EPA to research and collect data on these issues, focusing on communities near airports. The bill also provides grants for mitigation efforts to reduce the impacts of noise and emissions. The grants will fund programs to measure noise and emissions, develop mitigation strategies, and support various services like noise reduction, environmental services, and healthcare in affected communities. The EPA will report on the grant programs' activities and outcomes.",
