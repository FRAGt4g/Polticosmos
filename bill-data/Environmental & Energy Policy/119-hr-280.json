    "summary": "The \"Combating Obstruction Against Leasing Act of 2025\" (COAL Act) directs the Secretary of the Interior to expedite the approval of pending coal lease applications on federal lands. For \"qualified applications\" where environmental review has already started, the bill compels the Secretary to finalize assessments, determine market value, and grant the lease. It also requires granting any final approvals for previously awarded coal leases so mining can begin. Critically, the bill nullifies Secretarial Order 3338, a 2016 order that had paused new federal coal leasing, thereby clearing the way for future leases.",
