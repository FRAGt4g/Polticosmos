    "summary": "The bill, titled the Increasing Nuclear Safety Protocols for Extended Canister Transfers Act of 2025 (INSPECT Act of 2025), mandates the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to assign resident inspectors to permanently closed commercial nuclear power plants. These inspectors will oversee decommissioning activities and the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from spent fuel pools to dry storage. The inspector's duration is tied to the completion of the fuel transfer, and the NRC can reassign inspectors if those activities cease.",
