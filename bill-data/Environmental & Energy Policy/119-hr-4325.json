    "summary": "The Clean Shipping Act of 2025 aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from marine vessels. It mandates standards for fuel carbon intensity on covered voyages, setting percentage reductions below a 2027 baseline from 2030 to 2050. The bill also requires zero-emission standards for vessels at U.S. anchorage or berth by 2035. The EPA administrator is tasked with setting and enforcing these regulations, considering technological and economic feasibility, and potentially harmonizing with international standards. Monitoring, reporting, and public accessibility of data are included.",
