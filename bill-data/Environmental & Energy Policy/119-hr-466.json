    "summary": "The \"Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act\" (H.R. 466) prohibits the Secretary of Energy from spending money from the Nuclear Waste Fund to develop a nuclear waste repository without first obtaining formal consent. This consent must be in the form of a written, binding agreement with the governor of the proposed state, as well as with affected local governments, contiguous local governments through which waste would be transported, and affected Indian tribes. This legislation effectively gives state, local, and tribal governments the power to approve or veto the placement of a nuclear waste facility in their region.",
