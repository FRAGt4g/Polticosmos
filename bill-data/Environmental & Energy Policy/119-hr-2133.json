    "summary": "The Lakes Before Turbines Act (H.R. 2133) aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to eliminate the investment tax credit (ITC) for offshore wind facilities located in the inland navigable waters of the United States. Specifically, it prevents the ITC from applying to such facilities, except in the Great Lakes, effectively disincentivizing wind turbine projects in those areas after December 31, 2022.",
