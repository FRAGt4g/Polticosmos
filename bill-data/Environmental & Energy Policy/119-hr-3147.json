    "summary": "The 'Transparency and Honesty in Energy Regulations Act' (H.R. 3147) aims to prohibit federal agencies from using the social cost of carbon, methane, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gases in cost-benefit analyses, rulemakings, guidance, and other agency actions.  The bill also mandates that each federal agency report to Congress the use of these social cost metrics in their activities since January 2009. The bill's stated purpose is to ensure more transparency in energy regulations.",
