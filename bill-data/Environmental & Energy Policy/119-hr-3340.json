    "summary": "The Modernizing Access to Our Public Oceans Act mandates the Secretary of Commerce to standardize and publish geospatial data related to fishing restrictions, recreational vessel use, and access to the exclusive economic zone. The bill requires the development of a publicly accessible website containing this data, including navigation information and areas open or closed to recreational activities. It emphasizes data accessibility, regular updates, and a public comment process. The Secretary is required to collaborate with various stakeholders and coordinate with other federal agencies, ensuring the data's compliance with existing laws and regulations while explicitly stating the bill does not alter existing jurisdictional authorities or tribal rights.",
