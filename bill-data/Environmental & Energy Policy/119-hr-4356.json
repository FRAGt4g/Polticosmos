    "summary": "The Wild Horse and Burro Protection Act of 2025 aims to amend the Wild Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act. It prohibits or phases out the use of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft for gathering wild horses and burros, mandates camera use on aircraft during roundups, and requires a GAO report on humane alternatives and job creation related to equine population management. The bill highlights concerns about the inhumane nature of current methods and the high costs associated with using aircraft.",
