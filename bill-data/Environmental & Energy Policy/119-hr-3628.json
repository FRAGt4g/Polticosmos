    "summary": "This bill, the State Planning for Reliability and Affordability Act, amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to require state-regulated electric utilities that use integrated resource planning to ensure reliable electric energy availability over a 10-year period. This involves measures to maintain or procure electricity from reliable generation facilities, defined by operational characteristics like continuous operation capacity and fuel/energy source availability. The bill also establishes timelines for state regulatory authorities to consider and implement this new standard, with exemptions for states that have already taken similar actions.",
