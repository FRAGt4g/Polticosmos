    "summary": "Introduced as H.R. 133, the \"Protecting American Energy Production Act\" aims to limit the President's authority over hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking. The bill prohibits the President from declaring any moratorium on the use of fracking unless that moratorium is specifically authorized by a new Act of Congress. It also expresses the sense of Congress that individual states should retain the primary responsibility for regulating fracking activities for oil and natural gas production on state and private lands, thereby seeking to safeguard domestic energy production from executive action.",
