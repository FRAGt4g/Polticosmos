    "summary": "This bill, the Bureau of Land Management Mineral Spacing Act, aims to streamline oil and gas permitting. It amends the Mineral Leasing Act to exempt operators from needing federal drilling permits for activities on non-federal surface estates if the US holds less than 50% of subsurface mineral rights and the operator has a state permit.  It also clarifies that these activities are not considered major federal actions, exempting them from certain environmental and historic preservation regulations, while ensuring royalty payments and federal oversight of production. The bill specifically excludes Indian lands.",
