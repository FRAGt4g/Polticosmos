    "summary": "The 'Building Native Habitats at Federal Facilities Act' mandates the prioritization of native plants over non-native plants in federal projects, considering their benefits such as habitat creation and reduced environmental impact. Federal agencies must implement these requirements within 270 days of the Act's enactment, updating design standards accordingly. The Council on Environmental Quality is tasked with providing guidance and publishing biennial reports on native plant usage in federal projects, including case studies and impact analysis.",
