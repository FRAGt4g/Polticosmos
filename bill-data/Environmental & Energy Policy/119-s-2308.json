    "summary": "This bill, known as the Protecting America\u2019s Treasures by Raising Inflow from Overseas Tourists Parks Act (or PATRIOT Parks Act), amends the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act. It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to impose a surcharge on international visitors to units of the National Park System. The surcharge, determined by the park superintendent, aims to maximize revenue while maintaining visitation. Proceeds are retained by the park for maintenance and services. The bill also includes a surcharge on National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Passes purchased by international visitors, with funds going to the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund.",
