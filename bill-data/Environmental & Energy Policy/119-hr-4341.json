    "summary": "The International Maritime Pollution Accountability Act of 2025 aims to reduce pollution from the maritime shipping industry. It mandates the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to assess fees on shipping vessels based on their lifecycle carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions and emissions of criteria air pollutants within U.S. waters.  Revenue generated will fund programs for decarbonizing shipping, research, workforce development, harbor craft and ferry electrification, increased air monitoring, and support existing environmental programs.",
