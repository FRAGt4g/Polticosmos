    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 178, directs the Secretary of Agriculture to implement an aggressive wildfire suppression strategy on high-risk National Forest lands. It mandates using all available resources to extinguish wildfires within 24 hours of detection in areas experiencing severe drought, at the highest fire preparedness level, or with high-risk exposure. The legislation restricts the use of fire as a management tool, places strict controls on backfires, and requires the immediate suppression of prescribed burns that escape their boundaries. The bill ensures federal actions do not inhibit state or local firefighting efforts in these critical zones.",
