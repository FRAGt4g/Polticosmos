    "summary": "The Buffalo Tract Protection Act aims to protect approximately 4,288 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in New Mexico from mineral development. It withdraws the land from mining, mineral leasing, and geothermal leasing, subject to existing rights.  The bill also allows the Secretary of the Interior to convey the surface estate of the land, while reserving the mineral estate to the United States. The land is specifically identified by a map from 2019.",
