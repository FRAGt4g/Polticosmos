It also creates an Interagency Coordinating Committee on Wildfires and a National Advisory Committee on Wildfires, along with a fire weather testbed. The bill addresses incident meteorologist workforce challenges and includes provisions for overtime pay. Research into wildland fire communications and information dissemination is also mandated.",
