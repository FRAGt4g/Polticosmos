    "summary": "The Solid American Hardwood Tax Credit Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to offer a tax credit for natural carbon sink expenditures, specifically those related to hardwood products sourced and processed within the United States.  It defines 'natural carbon sink expenditures' and outlines eligibility requirements, extending the energy efficient home improvement credit. The bill also terminates an increased credit for carbon oxide sequestration. The amendments are effective for property placed in service or construction beginning after the bill's enactment.",
