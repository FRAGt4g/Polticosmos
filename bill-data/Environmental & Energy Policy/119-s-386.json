    "summary": "The Critical Water Resources Prioritization Act of 2025 amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to allow exemptions from consultation requirements for agency actions that fulfill critical human water needs. This includes drinking water, emergency services, public health/safety, and food security. Exemptions can be granted if requirements conflict with these needs, all reasonable conservation measures are in place, alternative sources were explored, and impacts on endangered species are minimized. Exemptions are initially for 180 days and can be renewed.  Water management agencies must report monthly, and the Secretary reports annually to Congress.",
