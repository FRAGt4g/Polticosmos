    "summary": "The Agency Accountability and Cost Transparency Act of 2025 mandates that federal agencies assess the cost of major rules they propose. Agencies must identify and repeal other rules to offset costs, determining whether a new rule is \"budget neutral.\" Each major rule published in the Federal Register must include a statement about its budget neutrality. The bill broadly defines key terms like \"major rule\" and \"cost of the rule,\" focusing on economic impact and public costs.",
