    "summary": "The Public Safety Free Speech Act aims to protect the free speech rights of public safety officers (law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel) regarding their opinions on public safety services, working conditions, and other employment-related matters. It allows covered employees to sue their employers for adverse employment actions taken due to these opinions. The bill outlines specific limitations, such as comments made on duty or those that incite violence or disclose confidential information. Relief for successful plaintiffs includes damages, injunctive relief, and legal fees. The act does not supersede existing civil rights laws.",
