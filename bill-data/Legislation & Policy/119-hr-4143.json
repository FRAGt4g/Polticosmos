    "summary": "The 3D Printed Gun Safety Act of 2025 aims to amend U.S. Code to prohibit the online distribution of digital instructions (CAD files and other code) that can be used to program 3D printers to produce firearms or complete firearm frames/receivers. The bill's intent is to address the growing concern of untraceable, 3D-printed firearms, which pose a threat to public safety and undermine existing federal firearms regulations. It references findings related to the capabilities of 3D printing in a way that allows people to bypass metal detectors and commit gun crimes.",
