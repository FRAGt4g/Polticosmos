    "summary": "The bill, the Protecting American Industry and Labor from International Trade Crimes Act of 2025, aims to strengthen the Department of Justice's (DOJ) enforcement against trade-related crimes. It defines these crimes broadly, including evasion of duties, smuggling, and trade-based money laundering. The bill mandates the establishment of a task force within the Criminal Division to investigate and prosecute these crimes, with a focus on specific statutory violations. It also outlines the duties of the task force, including increasing prosecution capabilities, training, and partnerships with other agencies. The bill authorizes $20 million in appropriations for fiscal year 2026 and requires an annual report to Congress on the DOJ's work in this area.",
