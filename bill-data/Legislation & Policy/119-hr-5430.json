It primarily focuses on school security by authorizing the use of matching grant program funds for hiring school resource officers (SROs), purchasing firearms/equipment for them, and buying vehicles for SROs. The bill also mandates technical assistance to improve grant access for rural/underserved areas and requires a report to Congress on this assistance.",
