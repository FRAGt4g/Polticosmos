    "summary": "The Promoting Free and Fair Elections Act of 2025 aims to limit federal agency involvement in voter registration and mobilization efforts. It prohibits agencies from using funds to solicit agreements with NGOs for voter-related activities on agency property or websites and restricts the use of federal funds for activities under Executive Order 14019. The bill mandates reports from agencies regarding their voter registration plans and activities and amends the Higher Education Act to prohibit voter registration/mobilization in Federal Work-Study programs. It targets agency actions related to voting and mandates reporting to congressional committees.",
