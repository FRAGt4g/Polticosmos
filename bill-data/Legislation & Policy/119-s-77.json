    "summary": "This bill, the Early Participation in Regulations Act of 2025, mandates that federal agencies publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in the Federal Register at least 90 days before publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking for any 'major rule.' A major rule is defined by its economic impact or potential for significant effects. The ANPRM must detail the problem being addressed, regulatory alternatives, and legal authority, and solicit public comment. The bill provides exceptions to the ANPRM requirement, notably if compliance is deemed not in the public interest or is impractical due to deadlines. Judicial review of OIRA determinations is limited.",
