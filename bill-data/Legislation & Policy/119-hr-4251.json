    "summary": "This bill, the Protecting Americans from Reckless Gun Dealers Act of 2025, mandates the Attorney General to submit an annual report to Congress detailing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives' (ATF) actions in issuing, revoking, and inspecting federal firearm licenses. The report will include data on inspections, violations, revocations (and non-renewals/surrenders), and reasons for not pursuing revocation. The bill also requires the Comptroller General to conduct a study on the ATF's effectiveness in these areas, focusing on systemic failures, geographic variability, and outcomes related to license revocation.",
