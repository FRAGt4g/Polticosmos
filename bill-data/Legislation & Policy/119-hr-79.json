    "summary": "The 'Freedom from Mandates Act' (H.R. 79) seeks to eliminate federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates. It nullifies Executive Orders 14042 and 14043, which required vaccinations for federal contractors and employees. The bill also prohibits the Secretary of Labor from issuing rules that mandate vaccination or testing in the workplace. Furthermore, it prevents the Secretary of Health and Human Services from requiring healthcare providers to mandate employee vaccination or testing as a condition for their participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, aiming to ban these federal requirements.",
