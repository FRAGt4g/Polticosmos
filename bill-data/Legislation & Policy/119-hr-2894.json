    "summary": "The SGE Ethics Enforcement Reform Act of 2025 aims to strengthen ethics regulations for special Government employees (SGEs). It modifies the definition of SGEs, addresses conflicts of interest by restricting communications with companies SGEs are involved with, mandates a public database of certain SGEs, and increases financial disclosure requirements. The bill also specifies when federal ethics rules, including those related to post-employment restrictions, apply to SGEs based on their tenure. It seeks to increase transparency and accountability regarding SGE activities.",
