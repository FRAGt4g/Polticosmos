    "summary": "The Judicial Administration and Improvement Act of 2025 proposes to split the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. It would create a new, smaller Ninth Circuit (California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and Pacific territories) and a new Twelfth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada). The bill specifies the number of judges for each circuit, establishes procedures for assigning current judges, authorizes new judgeships, and outlines the transition for pending cases. The act aims to reform the federal judicial structure in the western United States and would take effect one year after enactment.",
