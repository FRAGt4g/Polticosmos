    "summary": "This bill, the \"Proving Reserves Of Others\u2019 Funds Act\" (PROOF Act), mandates that digital exchanges and custodians obtain monthly attestations from independent auditing firms to prove they have sufficient reserves to cover customer assets. These reports are to be submitted to the Under Secretary of the Treasury, made public, and include cryptographic proof of reserves and liabilities. The bill outlines penalties for non-compliance, with a process for appeals and waivers, and requires the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to jointly develop an industry standard for these attestations. The bill aims to protect customer assets, prevent co-mingling of funds, and establish accountability within the digital asset market.",
