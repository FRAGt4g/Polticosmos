It addresses the reduction of federal employees, elimination of unnecessary regulations, and removal of operations not serving the public interest. It also modifies definitions of 'executive department' and sets limitations on reorganization plans, preventing net increases in federal workers or expenditures. Key dates are updated, and definitions within the law are amended.",
