    "summary": "The \"Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust in Congress Act\" (or TRUST in Congress Act) requires Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children to place specified investments into a qualified blind trust. This rule applies to assets like securities, commodities, and futures. Current members are given 180 days to comply, while newly elected members have 90 days. The bill mandates public certification of the trust's creation and excludes certain assets like widely held investment funds and U.S. Treasury bonds. The purpose is to enhance transparency and prevent conflicts of interest for lawmakers.",
