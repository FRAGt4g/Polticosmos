    "summary": "This bill, the Strengthening Immigration Procedures Act of 2025, amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish a procedure for addressing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in immigration matters. It allows aliens to raise such claims, defining 'immigration matter' broadly and establishing a 'prejudice' standard for evaluating deficient counsel performance. The act aims to eliminate the requirement of filing bar complaints and ensures that cases, regardless of their stage, are covered by the new rules.",
