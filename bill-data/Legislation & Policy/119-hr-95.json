    "summary": "The 'One Bill, One Subject Transparency Act' proposes to reform the legislative process by requiring that each bill or joint resolution enacted by Congress address only one subject. This single subject must be clearly and descriptively stated in the bill's title. The act establishes specific rules for appropriations bills, preventing them from containing non-germane legislation. It creates an enforcement mechanism where non-compliant laws, or parts of them, are rendered void. It also grants any aggrieved person, including Members of Congress, the right to sue the government to challenge laws passed in violation of this rule.",
