    "summary": "This bill, the \"Decentralizing and Reorganizing Agency Infrastructure Nation-wide To Harness Efficient Services, Workforce Administration, and Management Practices Act\" (DRAIN THE SWAMP Act), mandates that federal Executive agencies relocate at least 30% of their headquarters employees outside the Washington metropolitan area. It defines terms, outlines reporting requirements, and directs the Office of Management and Budget to reduce headquarters office space by at least 30%. The bill aims to promote geographic diversity, in-person customer service, and reduce reliance on headquarters operations. It also prevents relocation incentives and includes sections on severability and supersession.",
