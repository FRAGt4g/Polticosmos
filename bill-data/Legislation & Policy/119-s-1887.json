    "summary": "The 'Vote at Home Act of 2025' aims to expand voting access by mandating mail-in voting for federal elections. Key provisions include allowing states to only set deadlines for mail-in ballot requests and returns, requiring states to mail ballots to registered voters two weeks before elections, and providing ballot accessibility for individuals with disabilities. It also proposes free postage for ballots, streamlines voter registration through state motor vehicle authorities (including automatic registration for eligible citizens), and makes conforming amendments related to registration timing. The act seeks to increase voter turnout and reduce barriers to participation.",
