    "summary": "The Let America Vote Act requires states to permit unaffiliated (independent) voters to participate in a primary election for federal office of their choice. It uses federal election administration funding as an incentive for states to adopt similar open primary rules for state and local elections. The bill protects these voters\u2019 privacy by restricting the sharing of their data and preventing their party status from being changed. A separate provision explicitly prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections and conditions federal funds on states prohibiting it in state and local elections and ballot initiatives.",
