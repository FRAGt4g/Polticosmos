    "summary": "The \u201cSunset Chevron Act\u201d aims to terminate federal agency rules that were judicially upheld based on the Chevron deference doctrine. The bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to compile a list of all such active rules. It then establishes a staggered schedule for these rules to \u201csunset,\u201d or expire, thereby invalidating them. The first rule for each agency would expire 30 days after the list's publication, with subsequent rules expiring in 30-day intervals. The Act seeks to curtail federal regulatory power derived from judicial deference to an agency's interpretation of a statute.",
