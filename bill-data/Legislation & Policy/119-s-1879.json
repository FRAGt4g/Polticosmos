    "summary": "The 'Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act' mandates that members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children either divest or place covered investments (stocks, commodities, futures, and similar interests) into qualified blind trusts. Current members must comply within a set timeframe after enactment, and new members have a grace period after taking office. The bill outlines definitions, reporting requirements, enforcement mechanisms, and civil penalties for non-compliance, aiming to increase transparency and reduce potential conflicts of interest.",
