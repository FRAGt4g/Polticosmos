    "summary": "The Stop Illegal Campaign Coordination Act amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to treat certain expenditures as coordinated with a candidate or political party. Specifically, it addresses expenditures that are materially consistent with instructions, directions, guidance, or suggestions from a candidate or committee. The bill outlines factors the Federal Election Commission (FEC) should consider to determine if an expenditure is coordinated, including information about target audiences, suggested communication methods, and specific phrases or images used. The amendments apply to expenditures made on or after the date of enactment.",
