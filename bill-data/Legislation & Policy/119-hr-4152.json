    "summary": "The 'Safe Storage Saves Lives Act' (H.R. 4152) amends Title 18 of the United States Code to mandate that a compatible gun lock be provided to every firearm purchaser. It replaces \"handgun\" with \"firearm\" in relevant sections, broadens the definition of who must provide a gun lock, and requires gun sellers to offer compatible gun locks with every firearm sale. The bill also specifies penalties for non-compliance and suggests that collected fines be used for gun safety device distribution and public awareness campaigns.",
