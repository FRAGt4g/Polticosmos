    "summary": "The Racehorse Health and Safety Act of 2025 aims to improve horseracing integrity and safety by authorizing states to form an interstate compact. This compact would establish the Racehorse Health and Safety Organization (RHSO) to develop and enforce uniform medication control and racetrack safety rules for Thoroughbred, Standardbred, and Quarter Horse breeds. The bill repeals the existing Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act and outlines the RHSO's structure, duties, funding, and rule-making processes, including provisions for rule violations and administrative sanctions.",
