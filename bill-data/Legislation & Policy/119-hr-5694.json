    "summary": "The Alaska's Right To Ivory Sales and Tradition Act (ARTIST Act) amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. It protects the cultural practices and livelihoods of Alaska Native artisans who create handicrafts using marine mammal ivory. The bill defines \"authentic Alaska Native article of handicrafts and clothing\" and clarifies exemptions for Alaska Natives regarding the taking and sale of marine mammal parts. It also addresses limitations and regulations, while ensuring regulations are supported by substantial evidence, including Indigenous knowledge. The bill aims to allow the sale of these items in interstate commerce and specifies rules about edible portion marine mammals.",
