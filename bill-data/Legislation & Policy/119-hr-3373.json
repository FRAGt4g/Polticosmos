    "summary": "The Gun Hardware Oversight and Shipment Tracking Act of 2025, or the GHOST Act of 2025, mandates a federal system for reporting the interstate and foreign commerce shipment of firearm parts (barrels, slides, or bolt carriers). It requires entities to register shipments with the Attorney General, including details of the sender, recipient, method of transport, and a manifest. The bill also outlines penalties for non-compliance, including potential seizure of unregistered parts and fines/imprisonment and includes a safe harbor for delayed registration. The Act establishes a database accessible to law enforcement and exempt from FOIA disclosure. Penalties for violations range up to 10 years in prison.",
