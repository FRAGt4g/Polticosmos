    "summary": "The 'Tools to Address Known Exploitation by Immobilizing Technological Deepfakes On Websites and Networks Act' (TAKE IT DOWN Act) aims to combat the non-consensual sharing of intimate visual depictions, including those created through digital forgery. It amends the Communications Act of 1934 to criminalize the intentional disclosure of such content, establishing definitions and outlining offenses, exceptions, and penalties. The bill also mandates that covered platforms establish processes for individuals to report and request the removal of non-consensual depictions, with enforcement powers granted to the Federal Trade Commission.",
