    "summary": "The Special District Fairness and Accessibility Act aims to ensure special districts are recognized as local governments for federal financial assistance. The bill mandates the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance to agencies within 180 days clarifying how special districts should be recognized. Agencies must implement this guidance within a year. A report evaluating agency implementation is due to relevant committees within two years of the Act's enactment. The bill defines key terms like 'special district' and 'federal financial assistance'.",
