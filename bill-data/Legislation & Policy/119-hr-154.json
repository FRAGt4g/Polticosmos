    "summary": "The \"Election Day Act\" (H.R. 154) is a bipartisan bill introduced by Representatives Fitzpatrick and Dingell. It aims to establish Election Day as a new Federal holiday by amending Title 5 of the United States Code. The legislation would officially add \"Election Day\" to the list of public holidays for Federal employees. The stated purpose is to make it easier for citizens to vote by removing the barrier of a workday, thereby potentially increasing voter participation in federal elections. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.",
