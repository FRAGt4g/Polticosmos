    "summary": "The \"Restoring American Confidence in Elections Act\" (RACE Act) seeks to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002. It proposes new federal deadlines for states, requiring them to finish counting ballots in federal elections by 10 p.m. on election day and to certify the results within 48 hours of the election. The bill provides exceptions for these deadlines in cases of bona fide emergencies, such as major disasters, or technical difficulties with election equipment or software. These new requirements would apply to federal elections held after the act's enactment.",
