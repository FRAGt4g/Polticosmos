    "summary": "The Amateur Radio Emergency Preparedness Act (S. 459) amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prevent private land use restrictions from unreasonably limiting amateur radio operators' ability to install and maintain antennas. The bill aims to facilitate emergency communications, promote technical self-training, and provide guidance to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). It defines terms like \"amateur operator,\" \"antenna,\" and \"private land use restriction,\" and outlines permissible restrictions (e.g., safety and aesthetic considerations) while preempting those that unduly hinder amateur radio operations. It also specifies enforcement procedures and limits on prior approval, with the FCC instructed to issue relevant regulations within 180 days.",
