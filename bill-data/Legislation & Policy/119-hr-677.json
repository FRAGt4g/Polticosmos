    "summary": "The Expedited Appeals Review Act (EARA) aims to speed up the review of appeals of specific decisions made by the Department of the Interior. It allows parties appealing decisions to request expedited review by the Board of Land Appeals. If requested, the Board must issue a final decision within six months of the notice (but no sooner than 18 months from the initial appeal filing). Failure to meet this deadline makes the Interior's original decision final and subject to judicial review. The Act applies to pending and future appeals.",
