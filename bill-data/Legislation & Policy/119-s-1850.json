It introduces a lifetime ban on former members lobbying their former colleagues, extends the cooling-off period for Congressional staff, mandates improved reporting of lobbyist activities through a searchable online database, prohibits former lobbyists from being hired by Congress within six years of lobbying contacts, and increases penalties for lobbying violations. It further requires substantial lobbying entities to report certain former government officials and provides the Department of Justice oversight.",
