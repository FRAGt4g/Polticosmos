    "summary": "The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE Act) aims to decriminalize and deschedule cannabis at the federal level. It mandates expungement of prior cannabis convictions, establishes an Opportunity Trust Fund for community reinvestment, and imposes taxes on cannabis products. The bill addresses racial disparities in drug enforcement, provides for Small Business Administration programs to support cannabis-related businesses, and prevents discrimination in federal public benefits and immigration processes based on cannabis use. It also includes provisions for studies on the societal impact of legalization.",
