    "summary": "The University Accountability Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to penalize tax-exempt educational institutions for civil rights violations. It imposes a penalty for each violation, with the amount being the greater of $100,000 or 5% of administrative compensation. The bill mandates review of exempt status for institutions with repeated violations and requires reporting of violations on tax returns. Determinations overturned by the court are excluded. The act aims to ensure accountability and compliance with civil rights laws by educational institutions.",
