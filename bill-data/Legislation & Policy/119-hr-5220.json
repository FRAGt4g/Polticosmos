    "summary": "The Congressional Power of the Purse Act (H.R. 5220) aims to strengthen Congress's control over federal spending and oversight of the executive branch. It focuses on several areas: preventing impoundment, increasing transparency in budget reporting, establishing congressional review of national emergencies (the REPUBLIC Act), and limiting emergency authorities. The bill amends existing laws like the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the National Emergencies Act, and the Communications Act of 1934, as well as addressing the disclosure of presidential emergency action documents.",
