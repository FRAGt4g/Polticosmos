    "summary": "The \"Seventh Amendment Restoration Act\" (H.R. 432) proposes to allow any person or entity facing an enforcement action by a federal administrative agency to move their case from the agency's internal hearing process to a U.S. district court. The removal procedure would follow the existing process for transferring cases from state to federal court. This bill aims to shift certain regulatory disputes out of the administrative law system and into the federal judiciary, thereby, as the title suggests, providing access to a court and potentially the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial in such cases.",
