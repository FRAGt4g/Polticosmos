    "summary": "The Royalty Transparency Act aims to increase transparency regarding financial disclosures of executive branch employees. It mandates reporting of royalties received by employees and specific advisory committee members, particularly those related to public health. The bill amends existing laws to require reporting of royalty sources and amounts, publication of reports online, and provides procedures for access to reports by members of Congress. It also directs the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to ensure conflict-of-interest reviews for contractors include assessment of royalty payments.",
