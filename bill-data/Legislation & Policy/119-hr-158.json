    "summary": "The Citizen Legislature Anti-Corruption Reform of Elections Act (H.R. 158), or CLEAN Elections Act, mandates that all states use nonpartisan independent commissions to draw congressional districts, starting with the redistricting cycle after the 2020 census. A commission is defined as \"nonpartisan independent\" if it has an equal number of members from the state's two largest political parties and excludes elected officials. The bill also links federal election administration funding to a state's use of similar commissions for its own legislative redistricting, aiming to reduce partisan gerrymandering and enhance fair representation.",
