It defines \"firearm destroyer\" and \"covered method of firearm destruction,\" and outlines new reporting requirements for licensed dealers who destroy firearms, including those received from government entities. The bill also authorizes grants for eligible entities (state, local, or tribal governments) to pay licensed dealers to destroy firearms and mandates the Attorney General to issue regulations, including acceptable destruction methods and required record-keeping. The bill takes effect 180 days after enactment.",
