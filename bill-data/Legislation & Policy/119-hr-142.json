    "summary": "The \"Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2025\" (REINS Act) requires congressional approval for any \"major rule\" from a federal agency before it can take effect. A major rule is defined as having an annual economic impact of $100 million or more, or other significant economic consequences. Under this bill, after an agency submits a major rule, Congress must pass a joint resolution of approval for the rule to become effective. The legislation establishes expedited procedures for this review process, aiming to increase legislative accountability and transparency over the federal regulatory process.",
