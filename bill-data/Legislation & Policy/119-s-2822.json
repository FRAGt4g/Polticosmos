    "summary": "The Register America to Vote Act of 2025 aims to improve voter access by establishing automatic voter registration (AVR) nationwide. It mandates that states, with some exceptions, automatically register eligible citizens, primarily through interactions with state motor vehicle agencies and other state offices. The bill defines procedures, protections for voter information, and grants to states to implement AVR, including funding for electronic data transfer and public education. It also sets standards for data management and election security.  The legislation sets penalties for non-compliance and outlines the effective date.",
