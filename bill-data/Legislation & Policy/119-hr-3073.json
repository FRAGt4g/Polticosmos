    "summary": "This bill, the Shivwits Band of Paiutes Jurisdictional Clarity Act, aims to clarify civil and federal court jurisdiction regarding the Shivwits Band of Paiutes' lands. It grants the State of Utah civil jurisdiction over cases involving the tribe on its lands, while specifying that relevant contracts/agreements are part of interstate commerce under federal law. The bill also amends existing law to clarify the tribe's leasing authority. Importantly, it emphasizes that the bill does not waive the tribe's sovereign immunity.",
