    "summary": "The Daylight Act (H.R. 300) proposes an amendment to the Uniform Time Act of 1966. This bill would grant individual states the authority to observe daylight saving time for the entire year. Currently, federal law allows states to exempt themselves from daylight saving time and remain on standard time year-round, but it prohibits them from adopting daylight saving time permanently. This legislation provides states with a new option, allowing them to legally apply the one-hour time advancement for the duration of the year, giving them greater flexibility over their local time observance.",
