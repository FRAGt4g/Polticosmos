    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 3402, amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mandate that institutional investment managers disclose specific information regarding their use of proxy advisory firms. These disclosures include how the managers voted on shareholder proposals, the consistency of their votes with proxy firm recommendations, and an explanation of how they considered those recommendations. Larger investment managers (with at least $100 billion in assets) face additional requirements, such as clarifying voting obligations to customers and performing economic analyses before voting on certain proposals.",
