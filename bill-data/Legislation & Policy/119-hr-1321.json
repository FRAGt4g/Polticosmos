    "summary": "The 'Ending DOGE Conflicts Act' aims to extend financial disclosure requirements to special government employees who own or lead companies contracting with the federal government. It mandates these employees, in addition to existing requirements, to comply with financial disclosure regulations under Title 5 of the United States Code. The Director of the Office of Government Ethics will review and certify these disclosures, and until compliance is confirmed, the employee is prohibited from official duties related to their government employment.",
