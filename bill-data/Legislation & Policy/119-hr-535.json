    "summary": "The Inaugural Fund Integrity Act amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to regulate donations to Inaugural Committees. It prohibits donations from non-individuals and foreign nationals, restricts donations made in another's name, and sets a $50,000 individual donation limit, adjusted for inflation. The bill mandates detailed reporting of donations and disbursements, including those exceeding specific thresholds. It also includes conforming amendments for reporting requirements and committee status, with an effective date for inaugurations in 2029 and beyond.",
