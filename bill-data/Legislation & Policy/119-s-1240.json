    "summary": "The Defending America's Future Elections Act seeks to repeal Executive Order 14248, issued by President Trump, which it deems unconstitutional and would disenfranchise voters. The bill focuses on the authority over federal elections, asserting this power resides with Congress and the states, not the President. It prohibits the use of federal funds to implement the executive order and restricts access to state voter registration records by the Department of Government Efficiency.",
