    "summary": "The Quapaw Tribal Settlement Act of 2025 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to pay $137,500,000 to the Quapaw Nation and certain members, based on a recommendation from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. It establishes a trust account for the funds, administered by the Secretary of the Interior. The bill outlines a process for distributing the settlement proceeds, prioritizing a mutually agreed-upon distribution plan through mediation. If mediation fails, the Secretary will determine a final distribution plan following a hearing process.",
