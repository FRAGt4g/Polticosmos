The bill also introduces procedures for approving or disapproving revenue-increasing major rules and reviews existing rules. It appropriates funds for the Office of Management and Budget and the Comptroller General to implement these changes. Additionally, the Comptroller General is tasked with studying the economic costs of existing rules.",
