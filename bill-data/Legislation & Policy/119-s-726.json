    "summary": "Ethan's Law aims to reduce gun violence by requiring secure firearm storage. It amends U.S. Code to make it unlawful to store firearms where a minor or ineligible person could access them. Exceptions are made for secure storage or when the firearm is carried. Penalties include fines, enhanced penalties for injury/death resulting from violations, and firearm forfeiture. A Firearm Safe Storage Program is established to provide grants to states/tribes with similar laws. The bill also includes a 'Sense of Congress' regarding liability for violations.",
