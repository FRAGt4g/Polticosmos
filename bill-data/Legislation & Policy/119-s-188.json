    "summary": "The Free Speech Protection Act aims to prevent federal employees and contractors from directing online platforms to censor legal speech protected by the First Amendment. It defines key terms like \"covered information\" and \"covered platform,\" outlines employee prohibitions, establishes reporting requirements for communications between federal employees and platforms, and mandates the termination of the Disinformation Governance Board. The bill also amends the Communications Act of 1934 and addresses government grants related to misinformation/disinformation, alongside provisions for private lawsuits and FOIA requests.",
