    "summary": "The Stop Comstock Act (S. 951) aims to revise sections of the United States Code related to obscenity and materials deemed indecent or immoral. It amends Title 18, focusing on sections 552, 1461, and 1462, and also amends section 305(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930. The bill primarily removes language related to \u201cindecent\u201d materials, items for procuring abortions, and similar provisions. This likely streamlines existing laws concerning what materials are deemed illegal to send or receive.",
