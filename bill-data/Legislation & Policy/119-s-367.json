    "summary": "The 'Stop Arming Cartels Act of 2025' aims to restrict access to .50 caliber rifles. The bill prohibits the import, sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession of these rifles, with exceptions for government use and grandfathered rifles. It amends existing laws regarding firearms, including the National Firearms Act, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, to reflect these new restrictions and address related issues such as firearm sales reporting and federal firearm prohibitors for foreign narcotics traffickers. Specifically, the bill targets those who are designated as significant foreign narcotics traffickers and certain other foreign persons.",
