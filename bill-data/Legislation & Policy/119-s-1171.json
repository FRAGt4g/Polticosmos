    "summary": "The Congressional Oversight to Secure Transparency of Relocations Act (COST of Relocations Act) mandates that federal agencies conduct a benefit-cost analysis before relocating employment positions. This analysis must be submitted to the agency's Office of Inspector General, which then submits a report to Congress. The bill defines 'covered relocations' and specifies the required components of the benefit-cost analysis report, including stakeholder engagement, risk assessment, and mission impact. The bill aims to increase transparency and accountability in federal agency relocations involving significant employee position changes.",
