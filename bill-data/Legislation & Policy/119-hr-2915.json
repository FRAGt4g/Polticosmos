    "summary": "The 'Why Does the IRS Need Guns Act' prohibits the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from purchasing, receiving, or storing firearms and ammunition. It mandates the transfer of existing IRS-owned firearms and ammunition to the General Services Administration (GSA). The GSA is then required to sell firearms to licensed dealers and auction ammunition to the public, with proceeds going towards deficit reduction. Furthermore, the bill transfers the administration and enforcement of criminal tax provisions and related investigatory authority from the Treasury Department to the Attorney General, along with the Criminal Investigation Division's functions, personnel, and assets to the Department of Justice.",
