    "summary": "The Voter Purge Protection Act amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to prevent states from removing registered voters from the official list of voters for federal elections without objective and reliable evidence of ineligibility. It specifies what evidence is not considered reliable (e.g., failure to vote), requires notification of removed voters, and mandates public notice of list maintenance programs. It also sets conditions for sending notices to registrants about changes of residence and makes conforming amendments to other relevant acts, with an effective date upon enactment.",
