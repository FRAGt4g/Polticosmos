    "summary": "The 'Small Entity Update Act' mandates the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to study and revise the definition of \"small entity\" under securities laws. The SEC must conduct a study, considering market growth and aligning with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and submit recommendations to Congress. Subsequently, the SEC will revise its rules, with ongoing inflation adjustments. The goal is to ensure a meaningful number of entities are covered by the definition, which applies to chapter 6 of title 5 of the United States Code.",
