    "summary": "The Defund Government-Sponsored Propaganda Act (S. 518) aims to prohibit federal funding for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR). It mandates the transfer of funds, that would have gone to those organizations, to reduce the public debt. This act, introduced in the Senate in February 2025, effectively seeks to eliminate federal support for public broadcasting and redirects those funds.",
