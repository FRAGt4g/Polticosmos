    "summary": "The SMART Act of 2025 mandates retrospective review of major federal rules to improve their effectiveness. Agencies must now include frameworks for assessing the impacts of major rules, including regulatory objectives, data gathering plans, and timelines for review. The bill defines 'major rule' based on economic impact and other factors. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) will provide oversight and issue guidance. The bill also specifies judicial review limitations. The goal is to ensure rules are achieving their intended goals.",
