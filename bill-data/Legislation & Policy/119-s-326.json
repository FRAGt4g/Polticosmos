    "summary": "The American Music Fairness Act (S.326) amends Title 17 of the United States Code to address royalty payments for sound recordings. It grants performance rights for terrestrial radio broadcasts, similar to internet services. The bill specifies the timing of royalty proceedings, provides special protections (lower royalty rates) for small broadcasters, outlines distribution of certain royalties, and clarifies that the changes won't negatively impact songwriter royalties. It also directs the Copyright Royalty Judges to consider promotional values in determining royalty rates.",
