    "summary": "The 'Stop Act' (H.R. 415) amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit federal officeholders from directly soliciting campaign contributions. This ban applies to both written and verbal solicitations for any political committee or federal election activity. However, the bill clarifies that officeholders can still participate in fundraising events\u2014including planning, attending, or speaking\u2014as long as they do not personally ask for money in connection with the event. The legislation aims to reform campaign finance rules by limiting the direct involvement of incumbent politicians in fundraising.",
