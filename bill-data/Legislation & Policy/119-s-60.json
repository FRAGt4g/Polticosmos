    "summary": "The Write the Laws Act aims to curb the delegation of legislative power from Congress to administrative agencies, arguing it violates the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution. The bill amends Title 1 of the United States Code to prohibit delegation of legislative power, define what constitutes such delegation, and require a report from the Comptroller General on existing problematic statutes. It also includes an enforcement clause allowing legal challenges to actions based on improperly delegated powers and establishes a de novo standard of review. The bill emphasizes that federal law must be fully defined by acts of Congress.",
