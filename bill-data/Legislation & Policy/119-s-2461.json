    "summary": "The 'Promotion and Expansion of Private Employee Ownership Act of 2025' aims to increase employee ownership of S corporations through Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs). It amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Small Business Act to incentivize ESOPs, including full tax deferral for certain stock sales and ensuring ESOP businesses maintain small business status. The bill also establishes a Treasury office to assist with ESOPs and creates an Advocate for Employee Ownership within the Department of Labor to provide education, assistance, and advocacy. The act also includes provisions for reporting and public education and suggests legislative and administrative changes for Employee Ownership Programs.",
