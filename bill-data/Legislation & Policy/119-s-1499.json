    "summary": "The New Start Act of 2025 aims to establish a program providing competitive grants to organizations that offer entrepreneurial development programs for currently and formerly incarcerated individuals. The bill amends the Small Business Act to create the New Start Program. The program would award grants to organizations, including small business development centers, women's business centers, and SCORE chapters, to provide training, counseling, and resources to help justice-impacted individuals start or expand small businesses. The bill mandates reports on the program's activities and performance, and authorizes appropriations for the program's operation.",
