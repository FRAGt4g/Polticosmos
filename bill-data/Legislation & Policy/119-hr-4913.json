    "summary": "This bill, the \"CHALLENGES Act,\" amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to protect voters from bad-faith challenges to their registration status. It restricts who can challenge a voter's registration, requiring clear evidence of ineligibility and, in some cases, personal knowledge. The bill also sets requirements for online portals accepting such challenges and provides for enforcement, including civil actions with compensatory and punitive damages, as well as criminal penalties for knowingly or negligently submitting false challenges. It aims to safeguard voter registration and prevent harassment.",
