    "summary": "This bill, the \"Strengthening Tribal Real Estate Authority and Modernizing Land for Indigenous Nation Expansion Act\" (STREAMLINE ACT), aims to improve Tribal self-governance by streamlining the appraisal process for on-reservation trust land acquisitions. It allows the Secretary of the Interior to accept Tribal appraisals in lieu of federal appraisals under certain conditions, primarily when the Tribe operates a self-governance realty program and the appraisal conforms to professional standards. The bill also amends the Indian Land Consolidation Act, mandates transparency through tracking processing times and publishing a report, and clarifies the Department of the Interior's role in the process.",
