    "summary": "The 'Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act of 2025' (FAIR Act) aims to prohibit predispute arbitration agreements and joint-action waivers in employment, consumer, antitrust, and civil rights disputes. It amends Title 9 of the United States Code to invalidate such agreements, allowing individuals to pursue legal action. The bill defines these dispute types and addresses the applicability of the act, clarifying that its provisions are to be determined by a court, not an arbitrator. The act takes effect upon enactment and applies to disputes arising thereafter.",
