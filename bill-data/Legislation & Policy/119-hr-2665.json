    "summary": "The Trade Review Act of 2025 mandates that the President notify Congress within 48 hours of imposing or increasing import duties. The notification must include the reasoning and the potential impact on US businesses and consumers.  Duties are limited to 60 days unless Congress approves them via a joint resolution. The bill outlines the process for both approval and disapproval resolutions, including expedited procedures, and it clarifies that the act doesn't apply to anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The bill amends the Trade Act of 1974. ",
