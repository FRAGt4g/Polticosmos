Newlands from the memorial fountain at Chevy Chase Circle in Washington, D.C. It mandates the removal of the plaque, a stone projection, and any name carvings.  The items removed will be offered to Newlands' descendants for 60 days; otherwise, they will become National Park Service property and part of the Rock Creek Park museum collection.
