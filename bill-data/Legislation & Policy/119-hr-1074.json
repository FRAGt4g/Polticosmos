    "summary": "This bill, the Supreme Court Term Limits and Regular Appointments Act of 2025, proposes establishing regular term limits and appointment processes for Supreme Court justices. It mandates the President nominate a justice every two years (in the first and third years after a presidential election), effectively creating an 18-year term limit. It also outlines the process for handling vacancies, including the use of \"Senior Justices\" (retired justices) and clarifies the Senate's role in the confirmation process, deeming consent waived after 120 days. Amendments are made to existing sections of Title 28 of the United States Code.",
