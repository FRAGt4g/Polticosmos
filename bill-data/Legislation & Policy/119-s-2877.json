    "summary": "The No Stock Act aims to prohibit certain senior government officials, including members of Congress, the President, and Justices, from trading stocks and holding other 'covered financial interests.' It defines these interests and outlines divestiture requirements, enforcement mechanisms (including fines), and public disclosure mandates for ethics offices. The bill also amends existing laws like the Internal Revenue Code and the Lobbying Disclosure Act to align with the new regulations.",
