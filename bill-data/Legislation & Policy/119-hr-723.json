    "summary": "The Protect American Election Administration Act of 2025 aims to prevent states from accepting or using private funds, property, or services for administering federal elections, including voter education and registration. The bill makes an exception for donations of polling place or early voting site space. It also amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to reflect these changes and sets an effective date for the amendments to apply to elections held after the Act's enactment.",
