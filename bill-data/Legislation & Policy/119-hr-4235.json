    "summary": "This bill amends the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016 to clarify its intent and limit the use of time-based and other non-merits defenses in claims to recover Nazi-looted art. It specifies that defenses like laches and the act of state doctrine cannot be used to dismiss such claims. The bill also includes provisions on the applicability of the amendments to pending claims, nationwide service of process, and severability. The legislation aims to facilitate the recovery of artwork and other property lost during the Nazi era, irrespective of the victim's nationality.",
