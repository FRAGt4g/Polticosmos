    "summary": "The Redistricting Reform Act of 2025 aims to reform congressional redistricting. It mandates that states conduct redistricting through independent redistricting commissions, outlining detailed requirements for their composition, procedures, and criteria. The bill also bans mid-decade redistricting and establishes criteria for redistricting plans, prioritizing compliance with the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, and prohibiting partisan gerrymandering. It includes provisions for court intervention if states fail to comply and outlines administrative and enforcement mechanisms, including payments to states and civil enforcement.",
