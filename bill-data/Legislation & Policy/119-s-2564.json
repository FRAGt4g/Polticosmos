    "summary": "The Tribal Gaming Regulatory Compliance Act aims to ensure all federally recognized tribes eligible for gaming are regulated under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). It addresses a Supreme Court ruling regarding the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe, the only two tribes with overlapping gaming regulations. This bill seeks to eliminate redundant regulations, applying the IGRA consistently to these tribes, and amending the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act.",
