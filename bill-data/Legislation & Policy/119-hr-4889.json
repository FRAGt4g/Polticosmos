    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 4889, aims to limit Congressional redistricting in states to only one instance following a decennial census and apportionment. It asserts Congress's constitutional authority to regulate the time, place, and manner of House elections. The bill amends existing law to prevent states from redistricting again unless mandated by a court to comply with the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act. It explicitly states the act doesn't affect state or local elections and sets the effective date to after the November 2024 election.",
