    "summary": "This bill, the 'Assault Weapons Ban of 2025,' aims to regulate assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices. It defines these terms, restricts their import, sale, manufacture, transfer, and possession, with exemptions for certain individuals and organizations. It also mandates background checks for transfers of grandfathered assault weapons, imposes identification markings on these weapons and feeding devices, and allows for Byrne Grant funds to be used for buy-back programs. The bill amends existing sections of the United States Code related to firearms and includes a list of firearms exempt from the ban.",
