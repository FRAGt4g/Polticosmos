    "summary": "The Litigation Transparency Act of 2025 mandates disclosure of third-party beneficiaries in civil actions. It requires parties and their counsel to reveal the identity of anyone receiving payments contingent on the outcome of a case and to produce relevant agreements. Exceptions are made for loan repayments and reimbursement of attorney's fees. Disclosures must be made within specific timeframes, with a duty to correct any inaccuracies. The bill applies to pending and future civil actions.",
