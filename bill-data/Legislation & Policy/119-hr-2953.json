    "summary": "The 'All Economic Regulations are Transparent Act' (ALERT Act) mandates increased transparency for federal agencies regarding proposed and finalized rules. Agencies must submit monthly reports to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), detailing the nature, objectives, costs, and economic impact of each rule. OIRA will publish this information online, as well as an annual assessment of agency rule-making. Additionally, the Act establishes a six-month waiting period before most rules can take effect to allow for public review.",
