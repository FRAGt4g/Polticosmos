    "summary": "This bill, the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2025, amends the original 2016 act to clarify and strengthen provisions for recovering Nazi-looted art. It aims to prevent the dismissal of claims based on time-related defenses (like laches) and other non-merits defenses (like the act of state doctrine). The bill also addresses issues related to foreign state immunities and nationwide service of process. Furthermore, it specifies the applicability of the amendments to pending and future claims.",
