    "summary": "The 'Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History Act' aims to codify an Executive Order and reshape how American history is presented at federal sites like museums and parks, especially the Smithsonian. It criticizes perceived historical distortions and seeks to promote a narrative emphasizing American achievements, liberty, and shared values. The bill directs actions by the Vice President, OMB, and Interior Secretary to influence the Smithsonian, monument content, and historical presentations, while also providing funding for Independence National Historical Park. The core goal is to push against what it sees as divisive historical interpretations and promote a more 'uplifting' and 'unifying' view of American history.",
