    "summary": "The 'One Subject at a Time Act' aims to prevent Congress from including multiple unrelated subjects in a single bill. It mandates that each bill or joint resolution address only one subject, which must be clearly stated in the title. The bill outlines enforcement mechanisms, declaring entire acts or specific provisions void if they violate this 'one subject' rule, particularly focusing on appropriation bills. It also establishes a cause of action for aggrieved parties and Members of Congress in cases of non-compliance.",
