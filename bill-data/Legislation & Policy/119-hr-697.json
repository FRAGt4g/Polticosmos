    "summary": "This bill, the \"Enabling Necessary Discipline with the Defense of Executives\u2019 Endeavors to Properly Staff Their Agencies with Trustworthy Employees Act\" (also known as the \"End the Deep State Act\"), aims to establish a new Schedule Policy/Career within the excepted service for federal employees. It defines positions considered confidential, policy-making, or policy-advocating, and not subject to presidential transition. Agencies must review positions for inclusion in this new schedule, and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will issue regulations. The bill also addresses agency actions, prohibits certain personnel practices, and revokes Executive Order 14003, which protected the Federal Workforce.",
