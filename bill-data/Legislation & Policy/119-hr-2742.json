    "summary": "The 'DOGE Accountability and Transparency Act' mandates weekly reports to Congress from the Administrator of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency Service (DOGE). These reports must detail any actions DOGE takes affecting federal agencies, including changes to staffing, policies, costs, and data access. The bill aims to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse, ensuring transparency and oversight of DOGE's activities, particularly those initiated following an executive order on January 20, 2025. This includes providing an initial report summarizing activity between that date and the enactment of the Act.",
