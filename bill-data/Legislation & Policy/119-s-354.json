    "summary": "The bill, known as the \"SHOW UP Act of 2025,\" mandates Executive agencies to reinstate pre-pandemic telework policies, practices, and levels existing on December 31, 2019. It requires agencies, within 180 days of enactment, to submit to Congress a study on the impacts of expanded telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, including adverse effects on mission performance, costs, and security. Agencies must also submit a plan for future telework, certified by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, demonstrating performance improvement, cost reduction, and security. Expansion of telework is prohibited until these requirements are met.",
