    "summary": "The People's Response Act aims to establish a Division on Community Safety within the Department of Health and Human Services. It focuses on research, coordination, and funding for community-led approaches that reduce criminal legal contact and expand opportunity. The bill authorizes grants to community-based organizations, local governments, and states for programs that offer alternatives to law enforcement, support survivors of violence, and assist marginalized communities. It also establishes a National Advisory Committee, an Interagency Task Force, and first responder hiring grants.",
