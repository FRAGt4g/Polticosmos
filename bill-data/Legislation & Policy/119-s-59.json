    "summary": "The 'One Subject at a Time Act' aims to prevent the inclusion of multiple unrelated topics within a single Congressional bill. It mandates that each bill or joint resolution address only one subject, clearly expressed in its title. It further specifies limitations on appropriations bills, prohibiting the inclusion of unrelated general legislation or changes to existing law. The bill outlines enforcement provisions, including mechanisms for legal action by those aggrieved by non-compliance, and establishes a de novo standard of judicial review.",
