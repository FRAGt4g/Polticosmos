    "summary": "The Gun Safety Incentive Act aims to reduce gun violence through several measures. It mandates written notices promoting safe storage with firearm sales, establishes Attorney General-led best practices for safe storage in various locations, and creates a grant program for states and tribes to distribute safe storage devices. Additionally, the bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit for the purchase of safe firearm storage devices, encouraging their use. The Act specifies reporting requirements and allocates funding accordingly. Crucially, the bill ensures the provision of a clear and conspicuous written notice with each manufactured or imported handgun, rifle, or shotgun stating SAFE STORAGE SAVES LIVES and the address of the public website created by the Attorney General.",
