    "summary": "The Safe at Home Act mandates that federal executive agencies and courts accept designated addresses from individuals enrolled in state address confidentiality programs. The bill defines key terms like \"address confidentiality program,\" \"designated address,\" and \"executive agency,\" clarifies acceptance and use of these addresses, and establishes exemptions. It requires agencies to comply with program procedures for obtaining physical addresses, with exceptions for law enforcement and administrative needs, while ensuring the confidentiality and FOIA exemption of physical addresses. It also addresses notification when participation in a program ends.",
