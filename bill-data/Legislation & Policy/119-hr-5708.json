    "summary": "The Federal Employees Civil Relief Act aims to protect federal workers and contractors during government shutdowns and breaches of the debt limit. It provides temporary relief from certain civil liabilities, including evictions, foreclosures, liens, student loan defaults, and tax obligations. The bill also protects insurance policies and offers court-ordered stays or adjustments to obligations if a worker's ability to pay is impacted by the shutdown. Additionally, it outlines enforcement mechanisms, including civil actions and private rights of action, to ensure compliance with the Act.",
