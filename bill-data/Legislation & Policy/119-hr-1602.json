    "summary": "The Financial Privacy Act of 2025 mandates increased transparency and protections regarding Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reports. It requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to Congress on the number of BSA reports filed, agency access protocols, and any denials of access. The bill also mandates a review and revision of protocols to better tailor information collection, enforce disclosure prohibitions, and protect the rights of U.S. persons.  Crucially, the legislation includes a sunset clause, repealing these provisions after seven years.",
