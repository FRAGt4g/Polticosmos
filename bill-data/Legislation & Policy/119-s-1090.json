    "summary": "The Restraining Judicial Insurrectionist Act of 2025 amends 28 U.S. Code \u00a72284 to establish special procedures for civil actions that seek to restrain executive branch actions. It requires a three-judge district court for such cases, selected randomly by the Chief Justice. It dictates that a majority of the court must agree to grant equitable relief and limits a single judge's ability to appoint masters or rule on preliminary relief. It aims to alter how courts review executive actions.",
