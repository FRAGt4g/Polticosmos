    "summary": "The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act of 2025 aims to provide for media coverage of Federal court proceedings. It grants presiding judges in appellate and district courts the discretion to allow photographing, electronic recording, broadcasting, or televising of court proceedings. Key provisions include exceptions for due process violations, obscuring of witnesses, and guidelines for vulnerable witnesses. The bill also bars interlocutory appeals on coverage decisions, allows the Judicial Conference to issue guidelines, and addresses courtroom rules and audio confidentiality. The district court authority sunsets after three years.",
