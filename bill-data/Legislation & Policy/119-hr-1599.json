    "summary": "This bill, the Dismantling Investments in Violation of Ethical Standards through Trusts Act (H.R. 1599), aims to prevent conflicts of interest among senior federal employees by restricting their ability and that of their spouses and dependent children to hold, purchase, or sell certain financial instruments. It defines 'covered financial instruments,' provides exceptions, permits qualified blind trusts, and establishes penalties for violations, including disgorgement of profits. The bill mandates annual certifications of compliance, authorizes the supervising ethics office to enforce the law (including fines), and requires a Government Accountability Office audit. Additional sections also address the appointment of employees and funding for the Office of Government Ethics.",
