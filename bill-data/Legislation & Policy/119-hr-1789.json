    "summary": "This bill, the \"Promptly Ending Political Prosecutions and Executive Retaliation Act,\" aims to clarify the removability of certain legal actions against current and former Presidents and other senior Executive officials. It amends Title 28 of the United States Code, modifying the standards for removal of cases from state to federal courts, particularly those involving actions taken by federal officials under the color of their office, including a specific provision for dismissal of cases if they interfere with the duties of the President or Vice President. The bill also establishes a presumption of immunity for federal officials in such cases and outlines the process for determining immunity, including Attorney General representation or compensation for private counsel. Finally, the bill prohibits courts from limiting the scope of duties of the Executive Office of the President.",
