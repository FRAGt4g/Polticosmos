    "summary": "The \"INvestor Democracy is EXpected Act\" (INDEX Act) amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. It mandates that investment advisors of passively managed funds, which hold a significant voting authority, must arrange for \"pass-through voting\" of proxies for covered securities. This means they must vote in accordance with the instructions of the fund's investors. The bill outlines definitions, exceptions, and requirements for disseminating information to investors. The Act also addresses a passively managed fund holding the securities of another passively managed fund. The effective date is set two years after enactment.",
