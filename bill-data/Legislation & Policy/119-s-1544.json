    "summary": "The Insurance Data Protection Act (S. 1544) aims to limit the ability of the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and other financial regulators to directly collect data from insurance companies. It seeks to protect the confidentiality of nonpublicly available data, requiring regulators to obtain information from existing sources when possible and to comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act. The bill outlines data-sharing agreements with state regulators and clarifies the application of confidentiality agreements and federal disclosure requirements.",
