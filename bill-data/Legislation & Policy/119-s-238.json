    "summary": "The 'Full Responsibility and Expedited Enforcement Act' (FREE Act) aims to streamline federal permitting processes. It mandates agencies to evaluate their current permitting systems, considering the adoption of 'permitting by rule'. This involves specific written standards, applicant certification, and a streamlined approval process with deadlines. Agencies must report to Congress on their permitting practices, including challenges to implementing 'permitting by rule'. The bill also includes provisions for public comment, attorney fees for delays, and oversight, aiming to reduce delays and costs in federal permitting.",
