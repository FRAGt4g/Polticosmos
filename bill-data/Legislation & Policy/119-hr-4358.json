    "summary": "The Anti-Rigging Act of 2025 aims to limit Congressional redistricting by states to once per decade following the decennial census and apportionment. It amends existing law (2 U.S.C. 2c) to prevent states from redistricting again unless mandated by a court to comply with the Constitution or enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The bill clarifies that it does not affect state or local elections and specifies that the amendment applies to redistricting after the 2020 census.",
