    "summary": "The Cameras in the Courtroom Act (H.R. 2361) seeks to permit the televising of Supreme Court proceedings. It mandates that the Supreme Court allow television coverage of all open sessions, unless a majority of justices decide that such coverage would violate the due process rights of a party. The bill amends Chapter 45 of Title 28 of the United States Code to reflect this change.",
