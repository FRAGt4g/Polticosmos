It amends the Internal Revenue Code to deny medical expense deductions for such procedures. It also prohibits the use of federal funds through Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Medicare to pay for or assist with the purchase of health coverage for those procedures. Additionally, it excludes gender transition procedures from the definition of essential health benefits under the Affordable Care Act.",
