    "summary": "The SGE Ethics Enforcement Reform Act of 2025 aims to strengthen ethics regulations for Special Government Employees (SGEs). It modifies the definition of SGEs, restricts communications with agencies for certain SGEs, mandates a public database of SGEs, and increases financial disclosure requirements for some SGEs. The bill also specifies when federal ethics rules, including restrictions on outside compensation and conflicts of interest, apply to SGEs based on their length of service. Overall, the bill seeks to increase transparency and accountability regarding potential conflicts of interest.",
