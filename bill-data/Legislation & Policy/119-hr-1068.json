It allows manufacturers, sellers, and trade associations facing qualified civil liability actions in state courts to remove those cases to federal district courts. The federal court can then determine if the action qualifies and dismiss it accordingly. The bill aims to modify the jurisdiction of civil lawsuits related to the arms industry.",
