It allows individuals to bring civil actions against federal employees for such violations resulting in demonstrable harm, removing immunity for the employees. Additionally, the bill outlines remedies, including personal liability for the federal employee and potential reimbursement to the Department of Justice for legal representation if the employee is found liable. It also grants state attorneys general the authority to bring civil actions as parens patriae on behalf of state residents.",
