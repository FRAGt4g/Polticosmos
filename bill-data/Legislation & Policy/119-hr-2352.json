    "summary": "This bill, the Abolish Super PACs Act, aims to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to limit contributions to Super PACs. It targets the potential for corruption and the appearance of corruption, arguing that unlimited contributions to Super PACs undermine public faith in elections. The bill proposes to place reasonable limits on contributions to independent expenditure committees, defining them and setting an effective date for the changes.",
