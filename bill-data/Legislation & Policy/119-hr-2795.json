    "summary": "The 'End Judge Shopping Act' aims to limit the practice of 'judge shopping', where plaintiffs file lawsuits in specific divisions of U.S. District Courts to obtain favorable rulings. The bill amends Title 28 of the United States Code to mandate that civil actions seeking nationwide injunctions must be brought in a division with two or more active judges assigned. This seeks to prevent single-judge divisions from issuing rulings applicable across the entire nation.",
