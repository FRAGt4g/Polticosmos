    "summary": "The Censorship Accountability Act (S.67) aims to provide a legal recourse for individuals whose First Amendment rights are violated by federal employees. It allows citizens to sue federal employees (excluding the President and Vice President) for actions taken under color of law that infringe on their free speech rights. The bill allows for the potential awarding of attorney's fees to the prevailing party. It also includes a severability clause ensuring the rest of the act stands if a part is deemed unconstitutional.",
