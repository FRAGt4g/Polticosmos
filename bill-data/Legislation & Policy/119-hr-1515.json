    "summary": "The 'Guidance Out Of Darkness Act' (GOOD Act) aims to increase public access to agency guidance documents. It mandates that federal agencies publish these documents, along with rescinded guidance, in a central online location designated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The bill defines \"guidance document\" broadly and outlines requirements for organization, accessibility, and exemptions for sensitive information. It also stipulates a report on agency compliance and clarifies that the Act's provisions do not affect the validity of guidance documents or congressional review processes.",
