    "summary": "The Firearm Industry Non-Discrimination Act (FIND Act) prohibits the federal government from contracting with entities that discriminate against firearm or ammunition industries. It mandates contract clauses requiring contractors to certify they have no discriminatory policies or practices against firearm entities or trade associations. Subcontracts exceeding 10% of the prime contract value are also subject to this requirement. Penalties for violations include contract termination and potential debarment. The bill defines discrimination, firearm entities, and other relevant terms, and it provides specific exceptions for sole-source contracts.",
