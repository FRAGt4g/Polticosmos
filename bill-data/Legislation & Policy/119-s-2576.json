    "summary": "The Election Mail Act aims to improve election procedures related to mail-in ballots. Key provisions include requiring same-day processing of ballots by the Postal Service, mandating the use of intelligent mail barcodes on return envelopes, and requiring postmarks. Additionally, it addresses ballot visibility, treats election mail as First-Class mail, restricts operational changes during elections, and mandates annual consultations with Indian Tribes on voting access. The bill also establishes a uniform deadline for accepting mailed ballots.",
