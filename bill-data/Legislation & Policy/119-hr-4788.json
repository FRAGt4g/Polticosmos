    "summary": "This bill, HR 4788, mandates that the District of Columbia permit Members of Congress with valid concealed carry licenses from other states, or who are otherwise eligible to carry concealed firearms in their state of residence, to carry concealed firearms within the District. This is achieved by amending existing D.C. law to create an exception for members of Congress meeting specific criteria including possessing a valid state-issued permit and a valid photo identification, while not being prohibited by federal law from owning a firearm. The bill also defines 'Member of Congress' for this purpose.",
