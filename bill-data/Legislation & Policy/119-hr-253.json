    "summary": "The Bipartisan Restoring Faith in Government Act proposes a ban on Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependents from owning or trading certain financial instruments like individual stocks, securities, and commodities. To comply, individuals must divest within 90 days by either selling the assets or placing them in a pre-approved qualified blind trust. The bill includes exceptions for diversified funds, Treasury bonds, and state/local government bonds. Enforcement falls to the Attorney General, who can impose a civil penalty up to $50,000 for willful violations. The act also amends the tax code for divestitures.",
