    "summary": "This bill, the \"Stop Super PAC-Candidate Coordination Act,\" aims to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act to clarify the definition of 'coordinated expenditures' and treat them as contributions to candidates. It expands the definition of coordination to include payments for communications made in cooperation with candidates, committees, or their agents, even if a firewall is used.  It also clarifies and strengthens the ban on federal candidates and officeholders raising funds for super PACs that accept non-compliant donations.  The bill specifies penalties for violations and sets effective dates.",
