    "summary": "The 'Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act' (MEME Act) aims to prevent financial exploitation by public office holders. It prohibits covered individuals (President, VP, public officials, and their families) and adjacent individuals (high-ranking executive branch employees, military officers, and their families) from engaging in or benefiting from 'prohibited financial transactions,' including the issuance, sponsorship, or promotion of covered assets like securities, commodities, and digital assets (e.g., cryptocurrency). It establishes civil and criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, and allows for both disgorgement of profits and private right of action for those harmed, with conduct treated as unofficial acts.",
