    "summary": "The Equal Shot Act of 2025 aims to prevent the Small Business Administration (SBA) from discriminating against firearm entities, their affiliates, or firearm trade associations when they apply for financial assistance under the Small Business Act or the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The bill defines \"firearm entity,\" \"firearm entity affiliate,\" and \"firearm trade association\" to clarify the scope of the legislation. The core intention is equal treatment in the context of SBA assistance, regardless of the applicant's involvement in the firearms industry.",
