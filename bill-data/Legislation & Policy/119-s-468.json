    "summary": "The 'Safety Enhancements for Communities Using Reasonable and Effective Firearm Storage Act' (SECURE Firearm Storage Act) mandates stricter security measures for federally licensed firearms importers, manufacturers, and dealers. It requires secure storage of firearms when businesses are closed, involving hardened steel rods, locked safes, gun cabinets, or vaults. It also mandates secure storage of business records. The bill imposes penalties, including fines, license suspension, and revocation, for non-compliance. Applicants for federal firearms licenses must demonstrate compliance with these new security requirements. The effective dates for the storage requirements are one year and 90 days following enactment, respectively.",
