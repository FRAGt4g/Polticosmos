    "summary": "The Protect Our Watchdogs Act of 2025 aims to amend Title 5, United States Code, to establish a \"for-cause\" removal standard for Inspectors General. This means the President can only remove an Inspector General based on specific, documented grounds such as permanent incapacity, neglect of duty, malfeasance, conviction of a felony, violation of law, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or inefficiency. The bill also amends existing sections relating to removal and transfer of Inspectors General.",
