    "summary": "The Judicial Relief Clarification Act of 2025 aims to limit the scope of federal court orders. It prohibits courts from issuing injunctions or other forms of relief that restrain the enforcement of laws or compel actions benefiting non-parties, unless the non-party is represented in a representative capacity. The bill amends various sections of Title 28 and Title 5 of the United States Code, impacting temporary restraining orders, declaratory judgments, and judicial review. The legislation seeks to clarify and narrow the power of federal courts to issue broad injunctions.",
