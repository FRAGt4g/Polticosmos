    "summary": "H.R. 342, the \"Honor Inauguration Day Act,\" mandates that the U.S. flag must be flown at its highest peak on every presidential Inauguration Day. The bill presents this act as a way to celebrate America's electoral history and the expression of the people's will. It explicitly states that this requirement would override any other law or provision that might otherwise call for the flag to be lowered on that day, ensuring it is always displayed at full-staff to commemorate the peaceful transfer of power.",
