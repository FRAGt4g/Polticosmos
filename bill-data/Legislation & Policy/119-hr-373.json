    "summary": "The \u201cSecond Amendment Guarantee Act\u201d (H.R. 373) seeks to prevent states and localities from regulating rifles and shotguns more strictly than the federal government. It proposes amending U.S. Code to nullify any state or local laws imposing more restrictive regulations, licensing, taxes, or penalties on the design, manufacture, sale, or possession of these firearms, including their parts and accessories. This bill establishes a federal ceiling on gun control measures for rifles and shotguns, preempting stricter local laws. It also allows individuals to sue states for violations and recover attorney's fees.",
