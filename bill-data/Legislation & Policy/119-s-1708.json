    "summary": "The Regulatory Accountability Act (S.1708) aims to reform federal agency rulemaking processes. It amends Title 5 of the United States Code, defining key terms such as \u201cguidance\u201d and \u201cmajor rule,\u201d and outlines new procedures for agencies when creating regulations. Key provisions include requiring agencies to consider alternatives, perform cost-benefit analyses for major rules, and provide advance notice for significant rulemakings. The bill also establishes guidelines and oversight from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to ensure rules comply with the new standards and promotes review of existing regulations. Several conforming amendments are made to various existing laws to incorporate these new rulemaking procedures.",
