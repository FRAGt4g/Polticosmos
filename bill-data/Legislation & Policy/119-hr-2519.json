    "summary": "This bill proposes a per diem allowance for members of Congress to cover lodging, meals, and incidental expenses when traveling to and from the Washington Metropolitan Area to cast votes. It outlines eligibility criteria, exceptions (e.g., those residing in the area or receiving reimbursement through other allowances), and how the allowance will be calculated (based on GSA rates). The bill directs the House Administration and Senate Rules and Administration Committees to create regulations, ensuring the allowances are not taxed as earned income and supersedes previous travel expense regulations. It defines 'designated residence' and 'Washington Metropolitan Area.' The allowance applies to the 119th Congress and beyond.",
