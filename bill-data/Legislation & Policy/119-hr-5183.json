    "summary": "This bill, the District of Columbia Home Rule Improvement Act, modifies the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. It establishes a uniform 60-day congressional review period for D.C. laws, clarifies procedures for disapproving D.C. laws, executive orders, and regulations (including allowing disapproval of specific provisions), and prohibits the D.C. Council from withdrawing acts already transmitted to Congress. It also mandates an annual hearing and report on the state of the District. The bill amends the original act to define the time in which resolutions can be brought before congress and to ensure Congress is able to review laws made by the District of Columbia.",
