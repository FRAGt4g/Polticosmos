    "summary": "The Postal Service Transparency and Review Act aims to increase oversight of significant proposed changes to postal services. It mandates that the Postal Service submit proposals for changes affecting nationwide or district-level service to the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) for an advisory opinion 180 days before implementation. The PRC has 180 days to issue its opinion. The Postal Service cannot act on a change before the PRC's opinion, and the Commission can suspend implementations if the rules are not followed. The bill also subjects such proposals to Congressional review under Chapter 8 of title 5, with specific procedures for joint resolutions of disapproval.",
