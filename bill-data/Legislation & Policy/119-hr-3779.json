    "summary": "The STOCK Act 2.0 aims to strengthen financial transparency and prevent conflicts of interest within the U.S. government. It mandates reporting of payments from the federal government by certain officials, expands the STOCK Act's provisions to include Federal Reserve officials, tightens penalties for non-compliance, bans stock trading by a broader group of senior government officials, and improves electronic filing and public access to financial disclosure forms. The bill covers Members of Congress, high-level executive branch employees, judicial officers, and Federal Reserve officials, along with their spouses and dependent children.",
