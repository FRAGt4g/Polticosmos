    "summary": "The \"Ensuring Accountability in Agency Rulemaking Act\" seeks to increase accountability for federal regulations. It mandates that any rule issued by a federal agency must be personally signed by a presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate. The initiation of rules is restricted to senior appointees. An exception is provided if the agency head determines, on a nondelegable basis, that compliance would impede public safety or security, provided they notify the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). OIRA is also tasked with overseeing agency compliance with these new requirements.",
