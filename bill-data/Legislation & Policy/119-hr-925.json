    "summary": "The 'Dismantle DEI Act of 2025' aims to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices within the federal government. It defines prohibited DEI practices, rescinds related executive orders, and mandates the closure of DEI offices. The bill restricts the use of federal funds for DEI initiatives in various areas, including federal offices, training, contracting, grants, and advisory committees. It amends existing laws to prevent discrimination and prohibit certain practices related to employment and training, and provides for private citizens to sue anyone violating it.",
