    "summary": "This bill, the Make American Flags in America Act of 2025, mandates that all U.S. flags displayed on or procured by federal agencies must be made entirely in the United States. It defines 'Made in the United States' and 'Federal agency', provides implementation timelines, and instructs the Federal Trade Commission to study and report on the enforcement of country-of-origin labeling for flags, including recommendations for improvement. The bill aims to ensure flags used by the federal government are domestically produced.",
