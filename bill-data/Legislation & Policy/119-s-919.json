    "summary": "The 'Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025' (GENIUS Act) establishes a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins in the U.S. It defines stablecoins, outlines requirements for issuers (including reserve backing, disclosure, and redemption policies), sets standards for capital, liquidity, and risk management, and addresses AML/sanctions compliance. The bill also details state-level regulatory options, transition to federal oversight, and clarifies that stablecoins are not securities or commodities. It aims to promote interoperability, study non-payment stablecoins, and establish reciprocity for international stablecoins.",
