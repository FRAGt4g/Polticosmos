    "summary": "The Dismantle DEI Act of 2025 seeks to eliminate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs and practices within the federal government. It defines prohibited DEI practices, rescinds relevant executive orders, and mandates revisions to regulations across various agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget. The bill restricts the use of federal funds for DEI-related activities in areas like training, contracting, grants, and federal advisory committees. It also amends existing laws to prevent discrimination and prohibit personnel actions based on DEI-related factors. Specifically repeals programs and offices related to DEI across federal agencies, and provides for a private right of action for violations.",
