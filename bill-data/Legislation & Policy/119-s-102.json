    "summary": "The 'Reinforce Occupancy Obligations for Maximized Interagency Efficiency Act' (ROOMIE Act) mandates that federal agencies require at least 80% of employees to work in-person Monday-Friday and occupy at least 60% of their office space. The bill cites concerns about underutilized federal buildings and aims to increase in-person work and reduce wasted space. Non-compliance results in the sale or lease termination of the underutilized property. The Comptroller General will report on the implementation progress.",
