    "summary": "The Zero Based Regulations Act mandates a review of existing federal regulations, requiring agencies to assess their goals, costs, and alternatives. It establishes a schedule for reviewing regulations, mandates public input, and dictates a process for reinstating repealed rules. Furthermore, the bill restricts new rulemaking by agencies, imposing conditions like regulatory burden reduction, public hearings, and cost-benefit analysis. It also requires the designation of administrative rules coordinators and emphasizes transparency in the rulemaking process and periodic review of newly created rules.",
