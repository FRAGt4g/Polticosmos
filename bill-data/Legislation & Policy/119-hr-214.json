    "summary": "The \u201cDistrict of Columbia Legislative Home Rule Act\u201d proposes to amend the D.C. Home Rule Act to grant the District of Columbia greater legislative autonomy. The bill eliminates the requirement that laws passed by the D.C. Council be transmitted to the U.S. Congress for a review period. By repealing the provisions that allow Congress to pass a joint resolution of disapproval to block D.C. laws, this act would enable local legislation to take effect without congressional oversight. The change would apply to all D.C. acts finalized on or after the first day of the 119th Congress.",
