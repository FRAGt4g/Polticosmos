    "summary": "The Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act aims to address healthcare workforce shortages by recapturing unused employment-based immigrant visas. It amends existing law to make available up to 40,000 visas for healthcare professionals (25,000 for nurses and 15,000 for physicians) whose petitions are filed within three years of the Act's enactment. The bill also includes exemptions from country caps, provisions for premium and expedited processing, and requires attestation that hiring doesn't displace U.S. workers.",
