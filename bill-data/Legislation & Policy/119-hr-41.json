    "summary": "This bill, the 'Unrecognized Southeast Alaska Native Communities Recognition and Compensation Act,' seeks to rectify the omission of five Southeast Alaska Native communities (Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, Wrangell) from the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). It authorizes these communities to form 'Urban Corporations' and receive compensation by settling their land claims. The act provides for the conveyance of approximately 23,040 acres of federal surface estate to each new corporation, with the subsurface estate going to the Regional Corporation. It also establishes shareholder eligibility and outlines provisions for land management and public access.",
