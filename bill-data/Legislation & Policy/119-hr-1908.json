    "summary": "The 'End Congressional Stock Trading Act' (H.R. 1908) prohibits Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from owning or trading stocks and other securities.  It mandates divestment timelines based on the nature of the asset and when the individual becomes subject to the law. Exceptions are made for widely held investment funds, certain Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act shares and government retirement plans.  Violation incurs a civil penalty of up to $100,000, and includes tax code amendments related to nonrecognition of gain.  Guidance will be provided by congressional ethics committees.",
