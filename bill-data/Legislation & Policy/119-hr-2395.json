    "summary": "This bill, the \"Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act\" (SHORT Act), aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code and Title 18 of the United States Code concerning firearms. It seeks to remove short-barreled rifles and shotguns from the definition of firearms under the National Firearms Act, effectively deregulating them. It also addresses state laws regarding these weapons, preempting state taxes, registration, and record-keeping requirements. Furthermore, it mandates the destruction of specific records related to these firearms held by the Attorney General.",
