It outlines conditions, including direct delivery to adults 21+, verification of age via ID, and restrictions against resale. The USPS will create regulations, including a registration process for businesses. The bill also specifies that state and local laws regarding alcohol shipments remain in effect and addresses USPS liability. The changes will take effect upon the issuance of regulations or two years after enactment, whichever comes first.",
