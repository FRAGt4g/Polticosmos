    "summary": "The Drain the Swamp Act (H.R. 2857) introduced in the House of Representatives aims to codify Executive Order 13989, which deals with ethics commitments by executive branch personnel. The bill seeks to give this executive order the force of law, effectively making the ethical guidelines binding and permanent rather than subject to alteration by future administrations. The bill was introduced by Mr. Khanna, Ms. Tlaib, and Ms. Lee of Pennsylvania and was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.",
