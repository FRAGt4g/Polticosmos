    "summary": "The Guidance Clarity Act of 2025 mandates that federal agencies include a \"guidance clarity statement\" on certain guidance documents. This statement clarifies that the document does not have the force of law and is meant to provide clarity on existing laws or agency policies. The bill requires agencies to comply 30 days after the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issues related guidance, which must happen within 90 days of the Act's enactment.",
