    "summary": "The American Royalties Too Act of 2025 amends US copyright law to grant visual artists resale royalties. It defines terms like \"art market professional\" and \"commercial resale,\" and mandates a royalty for commercial resales of visual art copies priced at $5,000 or more. The royalty is 5% of the sale price (or a maximum of $50,000, adjusted annually). The bill outlines how royalties are collected, distributed to artists or their successors, and managed by designated \"visual artists\u2019 collecting societies\". It also includes provisions for unclaimed royalties, failure to pay royalties and gives the Register of Copyrights regulatory powers. A study on the law's implementation is required.",
