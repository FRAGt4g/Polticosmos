    "summary": "The Campaign Transparency Act aims to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The bill seeks to eliminate the thresholds for reporting the identification of individuals who contribute to political committees in federal elections. Essentially, this means more detailed reporting of campaign contributions, regardless of the contribution amount, to increase transparency. The changes apply to reports filed on or after the date the act is enacted.",
