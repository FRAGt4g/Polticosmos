    "summary": "The Protect Children Through Safe Gun Ownership Act aims to reduce gun violence through several measures. It mandates adult supervision for juveniles possessing handguns with parental consent, requires secure gun storage, and establishes penalties for violations. The bill also grants a private right of action to individuals harmed by unsecured firearms. Furthermore, it directs the Attorney General to implement regulations, including denying firearm transfers to those penalized for unsafe storage. Finally, the bill includes a grant program for safe gun storage education within local educational agencies, and mandates a report on implementation.",
