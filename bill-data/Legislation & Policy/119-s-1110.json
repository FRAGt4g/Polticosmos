    "summary": "This bill, the Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to Streamline the Code of Federal Regulations Act of 2025, mandates the use of AI to annually review the Code of Federal Regulations and identify redundant or outdated regulations. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, will implement this process. Agencies must then review regulations flagged by the AI and either amend or rescind them within a set timeframe. Determinations and explanations are made public, with a provision for classified annexes. The bill also expedites the rescission and amendment process for identified regulations.",
