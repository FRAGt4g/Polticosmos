    "summary": "The Gun Violence Prevention Through Financial Intelligence Act mandates the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to issue an advisory on how domestic terrorists and homegrown violent extremists procure firearms and accessories. FinCEN must request information from financial institutions to develop the advisory, consulting with the FBI, ATF, and firearm sellers. If sufficient information is gathered, FinCEN will issue the advisory within 540 days of enactment; otherwise, it will submit a report to Congress. The bill also requires FinCEN to define key terms, including 'firearm accessory,' 'homegrown violent extremist,' 'lone wolf,' and 'lone actor.'",
