    "summary": "This bill, the \"John Tanner and Jim Cooper Fairness and Independence in Redistricting Act,\" aims to reform congressional redistricting. It mandates that states can only redistrict once after a decennial census and apportionment. It requires redistricting to be done by independent commissions (or, failing that, the highest state court or a federal district court) and outlines detailed requirements for commission composition, criteria for drawing districts (e.g., population equality, contiguity), and public input. The bill also provides payment to the States for that purpose, and specifies when the legislation takes effect.",
