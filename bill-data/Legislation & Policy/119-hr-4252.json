    "summary": "The Extreme Risk Protection Order Expansion Act of 2025 aims to support state, tribal, and local efforts to remove firearms from individuals deemed dangerous to themselves or others. It establishes a grant program for eligible entities to implement extreme risk protection orders. The bill defines key terms, outlines requirements for state and tribal legislation, and mandates reporting to the Attorney General. It also amends federal law to include individuals subject to these court orders in firearm prohibitions and addresses full faith and credit for these orders across different jurisdictions. Furthermore the bill will require extreme risk protection orders to be reflected in the NICS system.",
