    "summary": "The Fisheries Data Modernization and Accuracy Act of 2025 aims to reform the Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of recreational fishing data collection. It mandates a standing committee within the National Academies to advise on data collection, allows states to implement their own data collection programs with federal support, and directs the Administrator of NOAA to use state-collected data. The bill also defines \"stock assessment\" and requires a stock assessment plan. It further introduces independent surveys for fish stock abundance and enhances transparency in the management process.",
