    "summary": "The Curbing Officials' Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act aims to prevent financial exploitation by public office holders, particularly regarding digital assets. It prohibits certain financial transactions involving digital assets by covered individuals and their immediate family. The bill introduces civil and criminal penalties for violations, mandates public officials' disclosure of cryptocurrency holdings, and requires certification from payment stablecoin issuers to ensure no public official profits from their operations. Finally, it calls for a GAO report on updating ethics laws related to digital assets.",
