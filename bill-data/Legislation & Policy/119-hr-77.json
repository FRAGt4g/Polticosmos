    "summary": "The Midnight Rules Relief Act (H.R. 77) amends the Congressional Review Act to streamline oversight of regulations issued during a president's final year in office. These 'midnight rules' could be bundled and disapproved 'en bloc' using a single joint resolution. This would allow Congress to more efficiently nullify multiple last-minute rules from a departing administration, which currently often require separate disapproval proceedings for each rule. The bill aims to strengthen Congress's ability to check the rulemaking power of executive branch agencies, particularly during a presidential transition.",
