    "summary": "This bill, the Prove It Act of 2025, aims to increase transparency and accountability in Federal regulatory decisions that affect small businesses. It amends existing law to require agencies to consider indirect costs of regulations on small entities, establish review procedures for certifications regarding the impact of proposed rules, mandate publication of guidance documents, and strengthen the periodic review process for existing rules impacting small businesses. The bill empowers the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to review certifications and sets deadlines for agencies to comply with the new requirements.",
