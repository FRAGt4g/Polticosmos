    "summary": "The ZOMBIE Act aims to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. It requires former federal candidates' authorized committees and leadership PACs to disburse all remaining funds after an election. This disbursement must occur before the candidate lobbies, becomes a foreign agent, or the end of the disbursement period. The bill outlines rules for disbursements, including paying obligations and permitted uses of remaining funds. Furthermore, the bill mandates that former candidates, who subsequently register as lobbyists or foreign agents, certify that their campaign committees are in compliance with these disbursement requirements. The amendments take effect starting with the November 2026 election.",
