    "summary": "The \"No Pay for Disarray Act\" aims to penalize members of Congress financially during government shutdowns. It mandates a reduction in their annual pay for each day the government is shut down. Specifically, for the 119th Congress, salaries will be held in escrow during shutdowns, to be released at the end of the term. The bill defines government shutdown and the term \"Member of Congress\", and its main goal is to incentivize timely budget approvals by disincentivizing Congress members to stall. This bill primarily addresses the issue of government functionality and fiscal accountability.",
