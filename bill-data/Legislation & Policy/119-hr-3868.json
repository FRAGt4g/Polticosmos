    "summary": "The 'Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2025' amends federal law to strengthen background check procedures for firearm transfers by extending the waiting period and adding new requirements for individuals whose checks are delayed. It mandates the Attorney General to create a petition form for applicants to challenge delays, and requires various reports to Congress regarding implementation, effectiveness, and impact on domestic violence victims. The bill addresses how long a licensee can rely on a NICS approval and lays out reporting requirements for denied transfers.",
