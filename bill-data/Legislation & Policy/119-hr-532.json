    "summary": "The Handgun Permit to Purchase Act aims to reduce gun violence through a grant program. It authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to states, local governments, and tribes for developing, implementing, and evaluating handgun purchaser licensing requirements.  Eligibility requires applicants to have laws mandating licenses for handgun purchases, including background checks, fingerprinting, and age restrictions.  The bill cites research on gun violence and the effectiveness of licensing laws. Funding is authorized to support these programs. ",
