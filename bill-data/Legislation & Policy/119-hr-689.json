    "summary": "The Full Responsibility and Expedited Enforcement Act (FREE Act) mandates federal agencies to evaluate their permitting systems and consider implementing 'permitting by rule'. This involves creating written standards, a simplified application process based on certification, and streamlined approval with deadlines. Agencies must report to Congress on existing permits, potential for permitting by rule, and challenges to implementation. The bill aims to reduce delays and costs associated with federal permitting processes, allowing agencies to focus on enforcement rather than gatekeeping. The Comptroller General will review the agency reports and progress.",
