    "summary": "The Tribal Gaming Regulatory Compliance Act aims to ensure all federally recognized tribes eligible for gaming are regulated under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). It addresses a Supreme Court ruling concerning the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama-Coushatta Tribes in Texas, clarifying that their gaming activities should be subject to IGRA, eliminating redundant regulatory language, and ensuring consistent regulation of tribal gaming across the United States. This includes amending the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama-Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act.",
