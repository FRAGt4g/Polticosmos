    "summary": "The Redistricting Reform Act of 2025 mandates that congressional redistricting be conducted by independent state commissions, instead of state legislatures. It outlines the structure and requirements for these commissions, including member eligibility, public input, and criteria for drawing districts. The bill also includes a ban on mid-decade redistricting, sets criteria for redistricting (population equalization, compliance with the Voting Rights Act, and avoiding partisan gerrymandering), and provides for court intervention if states fail to comply. It also includes provision for payments to states to help carry out redistricting.",
