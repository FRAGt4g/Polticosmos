    "summary": "The Safe Home Act of 2025 aims to address unregulated custody transfers of children, particularly adopted children. It defines unregulated custody transfers, highlighting the potential dangers associated with them, like lack of safety checks and potential for child trauma. The bill mandates public awareness campaigns, technical assistance for child welfare agencies, and a report to Congress on the causes, effects, and prevalence of such transfers, along with policy recommendations for prevention and response. It also amends existing legislation related to child abuse prevention and treatment.",
