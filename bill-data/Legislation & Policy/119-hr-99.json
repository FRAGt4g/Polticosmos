    "summary": "H.R. 99, the \"Protecting Businesses From Frivolous COVID Lawsuits Act of 2025,\" seeks to shield businesses from liability in lawsuits related to COVID-19 transmission. The bill mandates a specific jury instruction in federal civil actions that allege negligence. This instruction would establish the \"reasonable person\" standard of care and, critically, state as a matter of law that both the act of opening a business is reasonable and that negligence cannot be determined solely on the basis that a business was open. This raises the legal bar for plaintiffs seeking damages from businesses for COVID-19 exposure.",
