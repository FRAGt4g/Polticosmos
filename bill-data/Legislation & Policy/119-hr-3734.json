    "summary": "This bill, the \"Stop Millionaires Using Service for Kickbacks Act\" (Stop MUSK Act), aims to prevent conflicts of interest within the executive branch. It amends Title 18 of the United States Code to require executive branch officers and employees, specifically those in high-level positions, to recuse themselves from matters that could affect the financial interests of their previous employers. The bill expands the definition of 'previous employer' to include organizations where an official worked in various capacities, including as a consultant or contractor, within the four years preceding their government service.",
