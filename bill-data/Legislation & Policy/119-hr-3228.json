    "summary": "The 'Constitutional Hearing Protection Act' aims to remove firearm silencers from the definition of firearms under the Internal Revenue Code, effectively treating them the same as other firearms. It amends the Internal Revenue Code and Title 18 of the United States Code related to silencer regulation, including preemption of state laws, record destruction, and modifications to how silencers are identified and marked. The bill includes provisions for implementing these changes and clarifies that the act does not place firearms under the jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
