    "summary": "The Government Shutdown Prevention Act of 2025 (S.499) aims to prevent government shutdowns by automatically providing continuing appropriations for programs, projects, and activities when regular appropriations bills are not enacted by the start of a fiscal year. It sets funding levels based on the previous year's appropriations, with a gradual reduction over time. The bill amends Title 31 of the United States Code and includes provisions for apportionment of funds, application of terms and conditions, and exceptions for certain programs.",
