    "summary": "This bill, the FIREARM Act, aims to protect firearm licensees from overly aggressive regulatory enforcement. It defines terms like \"self-reported violation\" and \"uncorrectable violation.\" Key provisions include: providing licensees an opportunity to correct violations before enforcement actions, mandating the Attorney General to assist licensees in correcting self-reported violations, requiring notice before enforcement, and allowing direct judicial review of license revocations.  The bill also retroactively applies to licenses revoked under the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' Enhanced Regulatory Enforcement Policy, offering reapplication opportunities for affected licensees.",
