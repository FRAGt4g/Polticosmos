    "summary": "The Federal Employees Civil Relief Act (S. 2982) aims to protect federal employees and contractors during government shutdowns and breaches of the debt limit. It suspends certain civil liabilities, such as evictions, foreclosures, lien enforcement, and student loan defaults.  The bill provides for stays of proceedings, adjustments of obligations, and deferrals of income tax payments. It also safeguards insurance policies and provides for enforcement through civil actions, including private rights of action, for violations.",
