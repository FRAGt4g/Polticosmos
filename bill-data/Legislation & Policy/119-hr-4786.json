    "summary": "The Honest Elections and Campaign, No Gain Act (H.R. 4786) amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require authorized committees and leadership PACs of federal candidates to disburse unspent funds after an election. It sets a disbursement period and outlines permitted uses for the funds (e.g., returning contributions, donating to charities, or transferring to political parties). The bill also requires former candidates who become lobbyists or foreign agents to certify compliance with the disbursement requirements under penalty of perjury. These changes apply starting with the November 2026 general election.",
