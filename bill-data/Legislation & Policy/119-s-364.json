It addresses taxation, registration, and state laws related to silencers. The bill also mandates the destruction of silencer registration records and modifies sections of title 18 to clarify definitions and regulations, including serial number requirements for manufacturers. Finally, the bill imposes a tax on firearm silencers and mufflers.",
