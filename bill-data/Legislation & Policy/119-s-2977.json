    "summary": "The Fair Access to Swift and Timely Justice Act (FAST Justice Act) amends Chapter 77 of Title 5 of the United States Code concerning timely rulings by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) on appeals by federal employees and applicants. It allows employees/applicants to file a civil action in district court if the MSPB hasn't acted on their appeal within 120 days. The district court applies the appropriate standard of review, and MSPB proceedings are stayed while the civil action proceeds. This bill aims to improve the timeliness of judicial review for federal employee appeals.",
