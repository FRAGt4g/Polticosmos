    "summary": "This bill, the Regulatory Accountability Act (HR 3525), aims to reform federal agency rulemaking. It introduces new definitions (guidance, major guidance, major rule), mandates considerations for agencies during rulemaking, establishes procedures for notice and public comment, and requires agencies to assess impacts of major rules. It also clarifies judicial review standards and amends existing laws to align with these new rulemaking processes. The bill seeks to improve transparency, accountability, and the economic impact assessment of federal regulations.",
