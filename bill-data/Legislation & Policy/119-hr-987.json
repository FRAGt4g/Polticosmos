    "summary": "The \"Fair Access to Banking Act\" aims to prevent financial service providers from denying services to lawful businesses based on subjective criteria or political biases. It prohibits financial institutions (banks, credit unions, payment card networks) from withholding services from those in compliance with the law, particularly targeting institutions with significant assets or those using taxpayer-funded programs.  The bill also allows for civil action against institutions violating these provisions and mandates written justification for service denials.",
