    "summary": "The 'Protecting Privacy in Purchases Act' (H.R. 1181) aims to prevent payment card networks and covered entities from using merchant category codes (MCCs) that specifically identify firearms retailers. The bill prohibits assigning unique MCCs for firearms retailers compared to general merchandise or sporting goods stores. It grants the Attorney General enforcement powers, including investigations, notices of violation, and the ability to seek injunctions. The bill also preempts state and local laws regulating MCCs for firearm retailers and requires the Attorney General to submit an annual report to Congress. It defines key terms like 'firearms retailer' and 'covered entity'.",
