    "summary": "The PCAOB Enforcement Transparency Act of 2025 aims to increase transparency in the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) disciplinary proceedings. The bill amends the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to authorize open hearings and public access to PCAOB proceedings, unless the board determines otherwise. It also modifies the rules regarding the publication of determinations. The bill seeks to allow the public more oversight of the PCAOB's enforcement activities.",
