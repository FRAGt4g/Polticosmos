    "summary": "The \"Citizen Legislature Anti-Corruption Reform of Congress Act\" (CLEAN Congress Act) proposes two key reforms to increase accountability and transparency. First, it mandates that any bill presented to the President must contain only one subject, which must be clearly described in its title. This aims to prevent the practice of bundling unrelated provisions into a single piece of legislation. Second, the bill requires the equal application of laws to Members of Congress, nullifying any provision of law that provides them with an exception, thereby ensuring they are subject to the same rules as the general public.",
