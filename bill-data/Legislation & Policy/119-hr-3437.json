    "summary": "The Insurance Data Protection Act aims to limit how federal financial regulators collect and share data from insurance companies. It prohibits the Federal Insurance Office and other regulators from directly collecting certain data from insurance companies, requiring them to obtain it from other sources when available. The bill also establishes confidentiality measures for collected data, protecting its non-public status and outlining information-sharing agreements with state insurance regulators. Additionally, the bill amends the Financial Stability Act of 2010 to limit subpoena power and adds provisions for treating data collected from insurance companies.",
