    "summary": "The 'Break the Cycle of Violence Act' aims to reduce community violence by investing in community-based violence intervention initiatives. The bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants for programs focusing on evidence-based strategies, trauma-responsive care, economic opportunity, and support for those at high risk of violence. It also establishes an Office of Community Violence Intervention, a Community Violence Intervention Advisory Committee, and a National Community Violence Response Center. Additionally, the bill provides IMPACT grants through the Department of Labor for job training and workforce development programs targeted at opportunity youth in communities disproportionately affected by gun violence, supporting connections to in-demand occupations.",
