    "summary": "The Equal Voices Act aims to change the size and representation in the U.S. House of Representatives. It proposes setting the average district size at 500,000 constituents by adjusting the total number of representatives based on the decennial census. The bill also allows states to use multi-member districts and ranked-choice voting in elections, with detailed rules outlined for ballot design and tabulation. Furthermore, the bill establishes a commission to recommend the optimal number of House members if significant population changes occur, along with plans for additional resources.",
