    "summary": "The Congressional Whistleblower Protection Act of 2025 aims to shield federal employees, former employees, and job applicants, as well as those working for government contractors, from retaliation for reporting information to Congress. The bill amends existing law to clarify protections, establish administrative and judicial remedies, including potential legal action in federal court with the possibility of jury trials, and specifies the burden of proof. It defines \"covered individuals\" and \"Federal agency\" for the purpose of the act.",
