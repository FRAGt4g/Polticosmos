    "summary": "The 'Expediting Reform And Stopping Excess Regulations Act' (ERASER Act) mandates that federal agencies repeal three existing regulations before issuing a new one. For major rules, the cost of the new rule must also be less than or equal to the cost of the repealed rules. The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct studies on the number and economic cost of existing rules. This aims to reduce regulatory burden and potentially decrease costs associated with federal agency actions.",
