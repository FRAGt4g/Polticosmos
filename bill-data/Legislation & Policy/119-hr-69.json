    "summary": "This bill, the \"Freedom to Petition the Government Act,\" seeks to amend the District of Columbia Official Code. It proposes that nonprofit organizations (specifically 501(c) entities) will not be considered to be \"doing business\" in the District of Columbia when they hold meetings with federal officials, like Members of Congress. This exemption applies only if the meetings take place at federally owned or leased properties within D.C. The practical effect is to free these organizations from needing to register with the D.C. government simply for the act of petitioning or lobbying federal officials on federal property.",
