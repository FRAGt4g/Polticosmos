    "summary": "The STABLE GENIUS Act (S. 1803) aims to prevent members of Congress, the President, and candidates for federal office from engaging in financial transactions involving \"covered investments\" (defined as digital assets). It prohibits these individuals from buying, selling, or holding these assets during their time in office and for a year after.  Covered individuals must place covered investments in qualified blind trusts. The bill establishes penalties for violations, including civil penalties like fines and disgorgement of profits, and criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment.  It also includes reporting requirements and specifies that violations are considered unofficial acts, limiting liability.",
