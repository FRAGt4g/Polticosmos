This office will administer a grant program to support civic bridgebuilding initiatives across the U.S., focusing on reducing conflict, improving social cohesion, and addressing public concerns. The bill also mandates research and dissemination of best practices, a consultation process for stakeholders, and a pilot grant program. Funding is intended to come from donations, not federal funds.",
