    "summary": "The Modern Firearm Safety Act aims to prevent state and local governments from imposing specific design requirements on handguns that are not mandated by federal law. The bill argues that such requirements limit handgun choices for law-abiding citizens, increase prices, raise safety concerns, violate the Second Amendment, and restrain interstate commerce. It would amend existing federal law to prohibit the enforcement of these types of regulations, specifically listing features like loaded chamber indicators, magazine disconnects, and ammunition identification systems.",
