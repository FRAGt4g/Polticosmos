    "summary": "The 'Justice for Kennedy Act of 2025' mandates the full public disclosure of all government records related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination. Within 30 days, heads of the CIA, FBI, National Archives, and other key agencies must release all relevant documents in unredacted form. The act supersedes previous laws and a 2022 presidential memorandum that allowed for withholding records. It also directs the Attorney general to petition courts to unseal all related documents, including secret grand jury information, to ensure complete transparency regarding the historical event.",
