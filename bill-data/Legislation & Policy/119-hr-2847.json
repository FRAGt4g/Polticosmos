    "summary": "The 'Vote at Home Act of 2025' aims to expand voting access in federal elections. It mandates that states allow mail-in voting without excuses, provides free postage for ballots, and requires states to send ballots to registered voters at least two weeks before an election. It also streamlines voter registration through state motor vehicle authorities, including automatic voter registration for eligible citizens. The bill seeks to increase voter turnout and protects against voter fraud.",
