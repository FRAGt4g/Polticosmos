It restricts this authority to nonprofit corporations, as defined by section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, excluding those ineligible for tax exemptions if they establish such a fund. It also restricts solicitation of contributions and alters the treatment of government contractors. The Act includes an effective date and a transition period for existing funds.",
