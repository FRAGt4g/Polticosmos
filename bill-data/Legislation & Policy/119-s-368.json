    "summary": "The Bureaucratic Limitation and Overreach Control Act (BLOCK Act) aims to increase congressional oversight of federal agency rulemaking. It mandates congressional approval for rules with an expected annual cost of $50 million or more (major rules). It establishes procedures for congressional review, approval, and disapproval of rules, including deadlines and specific processes for joint resolutions. The bill also amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to account for budgetary effects of rules subject to congressional approval.",
