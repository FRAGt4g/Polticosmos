Key provisions include establishing a Federal-State partnership to eliminate tuition and fees at public colleges and universities, creating grant programs for historically Black colleges and minority-serving institutions, improving Federal Pell Grants, and providing inclusive student success grants. The bill also increases funding for Federal TRIO and GEAR UP programs and invests in historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal Colleges, and other minority-serving institutions. Several sections address specific issues such as college access for students in outlying areas and student eligibility determined by immigration statuses.",
