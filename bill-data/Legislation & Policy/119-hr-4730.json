    "summary": "The Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History Act aims to revise historical narratives presented in U.S. government spaces. It mandates actions to promote what the bill considers a positive view of American history, particularly in Smithsonian museums and Independence National Historical Park. The bill calls for the removal of content considered divisive or ideologically driven, and directs actions including the Vice President's involvement on the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian, funding for Independence Hall, and the review of monuments by the Secretary of the Interior.",
