It mandates the creation of a 'Federal Hiring Plan' that prioritizes highly skilled individuals dedicated to upholding the Constitution, while also preventing appointments based on factors like race, sex, or religion. The plan will aim to expedite hiring timelines, integrate technology, and improve candidate communication. The bill also includes provisions for agency-specific plans for Senior Executive Service positions and human resources best practices.",
