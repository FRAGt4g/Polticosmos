    "summary": "This bill, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2025, aims to increase congressional oversight of federal agency rulemaking. It mandates that major rules of the executive branch require a joint resolution of approval from Congress before taking effect. The bill also establishes procedures for congressional review of both major and nonmajor rules, including reporting requirements, Comptroller General assessments, and deadlines for action. It further addresses the expiration of rules, the publication of guidance documents, and provides exemptions for certain types of rules, while also amending the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act and mandating a government study on the economic cost of rules.",
