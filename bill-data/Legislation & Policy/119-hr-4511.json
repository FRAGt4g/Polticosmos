    "summary": "The 'Uncheck the Box Act' amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit soliciting and accepting recurring political contributions or donations without explicit affirmative consent from the donor. It mandates clear disclosure of contribution terms, including recurrence dates and amounts, and requires easy cancellation options. Passive actions, like failing to uncheck a pre-checked box, do not constitute affirmative consent. The Act's effective date is tied to either Federal Election Commission regulations or a 180-day period.",
