    "summary": "The 'Proving Residency for Overseas Voter Eligibility Act' (PROVE Act) amends the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. It requires non-military overseas voters to provide a verifiable mailing address within a state (either their current residence or that of a spouse, parent, or guardian) to receive an absentee ballot.  If they cannot, they may vote in the District of Columbia. The act takes effect for elections in 2026 and beyond, excluding absent uniformed services voters from the new requirements.",
