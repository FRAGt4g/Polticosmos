    "summary": "This bill, the Safe Storage Lockers for House Office Buildings Act, aims to allow authorized House of Representatives employees to bring self-defense weapons (pepper spray, stun guns, and firearms) into House office buildings for secure storage. It mandates the Capitol Police Board to install and operate storage lockers at building entrances within 180 days of the bill's enactment. The bill specifies the types of weapons allowed and defines 'employee' to include interns and fellows. It also amends existing legislation to accommodate this new provision.",
