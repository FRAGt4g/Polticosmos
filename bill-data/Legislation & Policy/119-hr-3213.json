    "summary": "The Restoring Court Authority Over Litigation Act of 2025 aims to reinforce State and Federal courts' control over the legal profession. It prohibits federal agencies from regulating attorneys' litigation activities and prevents opposing parties from suing attorneys for their litigation actions. The bill amends existing laws, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Act, to reflect these changes. The core idea is that attorneys engaged in litigation should be regulated exclusively by the courts and disciplinary bodies of the states they are licensed in, not by federal agencies or through private lawsuits by opposing parties.",
