    "summary": "The Sporting Goods Excise Tax Modernization Act aims to update the application of excise taxes on sporting goods. It amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat certain marketplace providers as importers for tax purposes when they facilitate sales of taxable sporting goods imported from outside the U.S. This primarily impacts online marketplaces and aims to clarify tax responsibilities. The bill includes provisions for related parties, defines key terms, and outlines an effective date, as well as a statement clarifying that the bill doesn't imply tax liability for those not explicitly defined as importers.",
