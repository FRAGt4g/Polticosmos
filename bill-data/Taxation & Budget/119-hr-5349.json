    "summary": "The Tax Court Improvement Act (H.R. 5349) aims to improve services provided to taxpayers by the Internal Revenue Service by providing greater judicial review. It authorizes subpoenas before hearings to facilitate settlements, allows special trial judges to hear additional cases and address contempt, clarifies the Tax Court's jurisdiction to apply equitable tolling in deficiency cases, and addresses the disqualification of judges and special trial judges. The bill amends various sections of the Internal Revenue Code related to these improvements.",
