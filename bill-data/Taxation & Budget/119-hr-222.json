    "summary": "This bill establishes the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, an 18-member bipartisan body tasked with improving the nation's fiscal outlook. The Commission must propose recommendations to balance the budget (excluding interest) within ten years and ensure long-term sustainability by addressing entitlement spending. The President would then submit these recommendations to Congress as a joint resolution. The bill creates expedited, non-amendable 'fast-track' legislative procedures for an up-or-down vote on the resolution in both the House and Senate, aiming to force action on fiscal policy reform.",
