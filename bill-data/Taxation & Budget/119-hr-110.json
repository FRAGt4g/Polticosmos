    "summary": "The Small Business Prosperity Act of 2025 (H.R. 110) proposes major amendments to the tax code. It aims to make the qualified business income (QBI) deduction permanent, significantly increasing the deduction amount and expanding its eligibility by removing limitations based on W-2 wages and business type. The bill also allows businesses to change their corporate structure without it being a taxable event, provided ownership is stable. Finally, it calls for the complete repeal of the federal estate tax for decedents dying after December 31, 2024, while retaining the basis step-up for inherited assets.",
