    "summary": "The Free Speech Fairness Act aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow charitable organizations, specifically those described in section 501(c)(3), greater flexibility in making statements related to political campaigns. The bill clarifies that such statements, if made in the ordinary course of the organization's exempt purpose and with minimal additional expense, will not jeopardize their tax-exempt status or be considered prohibited political activity. The Act is intended to take effect for taxable years ending after its enactment.",
