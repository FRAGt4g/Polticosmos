    "summary": "The \"End Oil and Gas Tax Subsidies Act of 2025\" (H.R. 383) proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate numerous tax incentives for the fossil fuel industry. The bill would repeal key provisions including the tax credits for enhanced oil recovery and production from marginal wells, and deductions for intangible drilling costs and percentage depletion. It also prohibits major integrated oil companies from using LIFO accounting, disallows the qualified business income deduction for oil and gas activities, and modifies foreign tax credit rules for oil income, with most changes effective after December 31, 2024.",
