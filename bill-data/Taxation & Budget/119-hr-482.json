    "summary": "The \"No Tax on Tips Act\" proposes amending the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to make tip income effectively tax-free for many workers. It creates a new tax deduction for up to $25,000 in 'qualified tips' for individuals in occupations that traditionally receive them, excluding high-income earners. This deduction would be available to all taxpayers, including those who do not itemize. The bill also extends an employer tax credit for Social Security taxes paid on tips (the FICA tip credit) to beauty service establishments like hair and nail salons. The provisions would apply to tax years after 2024.",
