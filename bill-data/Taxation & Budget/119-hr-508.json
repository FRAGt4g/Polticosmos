    "summary": "The \"Bring American Companies Home Act\" proposes to allow U.S. businesses to deduct expenses incurred when moving inventory, equipment, and supplies from China to the United States.  A trust fund will be established to offset the revenue reduction from this deduction, funded by tariffs collected on Chinese-made goods. Regulations will be issued to define eligible business moving expenses. The bill aims to incentivize companies to relocate their operations.",
