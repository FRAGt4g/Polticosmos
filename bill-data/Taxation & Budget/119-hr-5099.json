    "summary": "This bill, the Storing All Firearms Effectively and Safely Act (SAFES Act), amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a refundable tax credit for individuals who purchase certain gun safes. The credit covers 90% of the cost of eligible gun safes, with a limit of $500 for individuals and $1,000 for joint filers, reduced by credits taken in the prior six years. The bill differentiates between safes purchased before and after January 1, 2031, with later purchases needing to meet a standard of high effectiveness determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. It also prohibits collecting firearm ownership information as a condition for the credit.",
