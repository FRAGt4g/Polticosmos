    "summary": "This bill, the 'Reduction of Excess Business Holding Accrual Act,' amends the Internal Revenue Code regarding the tax on private foundation excess business holdings. It specifies that employee-owned stock purchased by a business enterprise from an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) and held as treasury stock is treated as outstanding voting stock for tax purposes, up to a 49% limit. This aims to clarify the tax treatment of ESOP-related stock transactions and applies to taxable years after the bill's enactment and stock purchases after December 31, 2019.",
