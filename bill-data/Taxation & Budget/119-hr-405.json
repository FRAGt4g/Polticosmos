    "summary": "The \"Keep Every Extra Penny Act of 2025\" (H.R. 405) is a bill that proposes to amend the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The core provision of the bill is to make overtime pay, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, exempt from federal income tax. If enacted, workers would be able to exclude their overtime compensation from their gross income for tax purposes, effectively providing a tax cut on those earnings. This change would apply to all overtime wages received after the date the bill becomes law.",
