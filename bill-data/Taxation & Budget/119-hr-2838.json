    "summary": "This bill, the \"Ending Intermittent Energy Subsidies Act of 2025,\" aims to phase out clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar energy. Sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are amended to reduce these credits over a four-year period, effectively reducing government subsidies for these renewable energy sources. This phase-out applies to both production and investment credits.",
