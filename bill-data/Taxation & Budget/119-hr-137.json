    "summary": "The TCJA Permanency Act (H.R. 137) seeks to make permanent various tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that are set to expire. The bill focuses on changes affecting individuals, families, and small businesses. Key provisions include maintaining the current individual income tax rates, the higher standard deduction, the increased child tax credit, and the deduction for qualified pass-through business income. It also makes permanent the increased estate tax exemption and limitations on deductions for state and local taxes (SALT). The legislation aims to prevent a future tax increase by locking in these tax code changes.",
