    "summary": "The Economic Opportunity for Distressed Communities Act aims to incentivize investment in economically distressed areas, specifically brownfield and superfund sites. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish special rules for capital gains reinvested in \"qualified distressed opportunity funds.\" These funds must invest in \"qualified distressed opportunity zone property,\" which includes stock, partnership interests, and business property within designated zones. The bill offers tax benefits, such as deferral of capital gains and potential basis adjustments based on the investment holding period, encouraging long-term investment. Penalties apply if funds fail to meet investment requirements. It provides a significant tax incentive focusing on revitalizing economically depressed areas by channeling investment.",
