It establishes a refundable monthly child tax credit, with the amount varying based on the child's age and the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income. The bill includes provisions for advance payments, eligibility criteria (including requirements for care and residency), and inflation adjustments. It also introduces a credit for certain other dependents. The bill outlines rules for payment reconciliation, applications in US possessions, and lays out details on information disclosure.",
