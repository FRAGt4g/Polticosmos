The bill targets companies with ratios greater than 50:1, with the tax increase escalating based on the disparity. It also includes provisions for calculating the pay ratio, exemptions for certain corporations, and other conforming amendments related to this tax change. The amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, and directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue anti-avoidance regulations.",
