    "summary": "The Auto Reenroll Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to allow for periodic automatic reenrollment in qualified and eligible automatic contribution arrangements in retirement plans. This means that employees who opt out of contributing to a retirement plan may be automatically reenrolled after a period (between 1 and 3 years) unless they actively choose to opt out again. The bill also specifies that these changes apply to plan years beginning after the date of the Act's enactment, without creating inferences about prior years.",
