    "summary": "The Higher Education Accountability Tax Act proposes changes to the excise tax on investment income of private colleges and universities. It increases the tax rate, with further increases for institutions where the net price of education has increased faster than inflation. The bill also expands the scope of institutions subject to the tax by lowering the asset threshold. These changes apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
