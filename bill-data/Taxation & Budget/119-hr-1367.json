    "summary": "The Eliminate Lavish Incentives To Electric Vehicles Act (ELITE Vehicles Act) aims to repeal several tax credits related to electric vehicles. This includes credits for new clean vehicles (30D), previously-owned clean vehicles (25E), qualified commercial clean vehicles (45W), and electric vehicle recharging property (30C). The bill specifies effective dates for these changes, generally applying to purchases made 30 days after the act's enactment. It modifies several sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to remove these incentives.",
