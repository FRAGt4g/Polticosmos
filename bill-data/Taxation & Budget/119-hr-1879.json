    "summary": "The 'No Tax Breaks for Sanctuary Cities Act' aims to deny tax-exempt status for bonds issued by state and local governments that have policies restricting cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The bill defines \"sanctuary jurisdiction\" and requires the Treasury Secretary to publish an annual list of such jurisdictions. The changes would apply to bonds issued after the bill's enactment.",
