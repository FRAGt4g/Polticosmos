    "summary": "This bill, the Honor and Hire Veterans Act of 2025, aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to incentivize employers to hire veterans. It increases the work opportunity credit for qualified veterans to 50% of first-year wages, and also increases the limitation on wages taken into account. Additionally, it modifies the credit for veterans who do not meet minimum employment periods and sets an effective date for these changes, applying to individuals who start working after the Act's enactment.",
