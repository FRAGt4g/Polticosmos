    "summary": "This bill, the \"Fortifying Income by Giving our Heroes Their Earned-Tax Relief Act of 2025\" (or FIGHTER Act), amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt regular compensation for active service in the Armed Forces from income taxes. It includes exceptions for former Members of Congress and mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to adjust withholding procedures accordingly.  Furthermore, it directs the United States DOGE Service to implement cost-saving measures to offset the revenue reduction resulting from the tax changes.",
