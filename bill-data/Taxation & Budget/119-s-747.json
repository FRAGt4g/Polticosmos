    "summary": "The Improper Payments Transparency Act (S. 747) aims to increase transparency regarding improper payments within federal programs. The bill amends Title 31 of the United States Code to require the President's budget submission to include information on the amounts, rates, and trends of improper payments for each executive agency. It also mandates a narrative description explaining the causes of improper payments and requires reporting on corrective actions being taken to address these issues. The bill's intention is to provide greater accountability for taxpayer dollars by disclosing and analyzing financial inefficiencies within government programs.",
