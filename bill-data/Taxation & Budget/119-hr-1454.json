It introduces specific provisions for 'applicable rural projects,' including higher credit percentages, a $5 million expenditure limitation, and allows for credit transfers. It also introduces recapture rules for projects failing to meet affordable housing requirements and eliminates basis adjustments for the rehabilitation credit in these rural projects, with effective dates of 2026. The act aims to encourage investment and preservation in rural communities .",
