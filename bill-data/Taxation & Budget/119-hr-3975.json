    "summary": "This bill, the Tax Fairness for Disaster Victims Act, amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow taxpayers in federally declared disaster areas to use their earned income and social security taxes from the preceding year when calculating certain tax credits if those amounts are higher than the current year's. This lookback rule aims to help disaster victims by using a 'lookback' at the previous year's earned income and social security liability, thus preventing a reduction in certain tax credits due to disaster-related financial losses. It also addresses the treatment of incorrect use of these figures as mathematical or clerical errors and specifies the effective date of the amendments.",
