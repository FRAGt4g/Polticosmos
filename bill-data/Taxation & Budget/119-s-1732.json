    "summary": "The CHEERS Act (S. 1732) amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to incentivize the use of energy-efficient kegs in restaurants, bars, and entertainment venues. It treats qualified energy-efficient draft property (stainless steel or aluminum kegs and related equipment) as energy-efficient commercial building property, allowing businesses to potentially receive a tax deduction. The bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations for its implementation, including guidance for businesses that rent or lease the equipment. The amendment applies to property placed in service after the bill's enactment.",
