    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 1959, aims to protect small businesses from increased unemployment insurance premiums due to unrepaid state advances. It amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Specifically, it prevents the reduction of unemployment tax credits for specified small businesses (defined as those with fewer than 500 employees) due to these unpaid state advances. The legislation is sponsored by Ms. Tenney and Mr. Smucker and would apply to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment.",
