    "summary": "The Gas Prices Relief Act of 2025 proposes a gasoline tax holiday. It amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to eliminate the federal gasoline tax and the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund financing rate for gasoline removed, entered, or sold between the enactment date and January 1, 2026. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer funds to the Highway Trust Fund and the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund to offset the revenue loss. The bill also emphasizes that consumers should immediately benefit from the tax reduction and empowers the Secretary to ensure this.",
