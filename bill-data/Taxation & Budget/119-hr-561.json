    "summary": "The Overtime Pay Tax Relief Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a deduction for overtime compensation. This deduction is capped at 20% of an individual's other wages from the same employer.  There are income limitations based on filing status, and the deduction expires after December 31, 2029.  The bill also modifies withholding procedures and ensures the deduction is available to both itemizers and non-itemizers, without impacting certain limitations.",
