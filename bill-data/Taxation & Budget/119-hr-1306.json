    "summary": "The Tax Fairness for Survivors Act aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income any judgments, awards, and settlements related to sexual assault or sexual harassment claims. This includes backpay, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. The bill also makes corresponding changes to social security, railroad retirement, unemployment taxes, and wage withholding to reflect the tax exclusion. The amendments will apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the Act's enactment.",
