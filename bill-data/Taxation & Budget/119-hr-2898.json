    "summary": "The EITC Lookback Act (H.R. 2898) proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow taxpayers to use their earned income from the prior tax year when calculating the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) if their current year's income is lower. This provision, if enacted, would provide a more favorable tax credit calculation for individuals experiencing a decrease in income, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
