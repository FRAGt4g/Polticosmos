    "summary": "This bill, the 'No Capital Gains Allowance for American Adversaries Act,' amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat gains and dividends from investments in 'countries of concern' (China, Russia, Belarus, Iran, and North Korea) as ordinary income rather than capital gains. It defines 'countries of concern' property, mandates SEC rulemaking for notifications to investors, and requires the SEC to publish a list of affected securities. The bill also denies a step-up in basis at death for such property and takes effect January 1, 2026.",
