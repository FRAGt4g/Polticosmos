    "summary": "The Save Our Seniors Act (H.R. 4793) aims to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The bill mandates the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to provide Congress with information on payments from the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. This includes a graphical comparison of assumed amounts versus actual outlays from these funds. The goal is to provide greater transparency and oversight of these critical social security programs.",
