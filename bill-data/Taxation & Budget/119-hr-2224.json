    "summary": "The 'Tar Sands Tax Loophole Elimination Act' amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify that products derived from tar sands are considered crude oil for federal excise tax purposes on petroleum. It expands the definition of 'crude oil' to include various bitumen-based oils.  The bill also grants the Secretary of the Treasury regulatory authority to classify other fuel feedstocks and products as taxable if they meet specific criteria related to the Oil Pollution Act and commercial production quantities. The amendments take effect upon enactment.",
