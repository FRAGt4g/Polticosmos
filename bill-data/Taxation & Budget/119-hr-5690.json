    "summary": "The Emergency Relief for Federal Contractors Act of 2025 allows federal contractors and certain employees affected by government shutdowns to withdraw money from their retirement accounts without penalty. Distributions are limited to $30,000, with adjustments for inflation. Individuals can repay the withdrawn amount within three years, and the bill outlines how these repayments are treated for tax purposes. The bill defines who qualifies, specifies that the income inclusion can be spread over three years and makes provisions for other regulations.",
