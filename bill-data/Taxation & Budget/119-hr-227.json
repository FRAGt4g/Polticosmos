    "summary": "The Clergy Act (H.R. 227) allows clergy members who previously opted out of Social Security to rejoin the system. It establishes a limited window for ministers, members of religious orders, and Christian Science practitioners to revoke their exemption. The revocation, which is permanent, would be effective for taxable years beginning after 2027. The bill requires late filers to pay back taxes for the effective year. It also directs the IRS and Social Security Administration to develop a plan to inform eligible clergy of this opportunity to gain future Social Security coverage.",
