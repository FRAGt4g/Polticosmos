    "summary": "The \"FAIR PREP Act of 2025\" seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from offering a direct, government-run electronic tax preparation and filing service, such as the IRS \"Direct File\" program. The bill treats tax returns prepared using such a system as if they were prepared by the Secretary, an act it aims to forbid. It explicitly exempts the existing public-private IRS Free File Program partnership and the provision of fillable forms. The legislation also restricts future federal spending on developing or operating such a government tax prep service without explicit congressional authorization.",
