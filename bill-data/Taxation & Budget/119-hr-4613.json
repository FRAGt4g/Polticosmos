    "summary": "The Bubble Tax Modernization Act of 2025 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding the taxation of wine. Specifically, it seeks to remove the distinction between mead and low alcohol by volume wine for tax purposes, effectively setting the same tax rate for both.  The act defines 'low alcohol by volume wine' by specifying alcohol content and carbon dioxide levels. The changes made by the bill would take effect after December 31, 2025.",
