    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 366, proposes an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It mandates that all federal taxes collected on fuel that is produced in the U.S. Virgin Islands and subsequently imported into the United States be transferred directly into the treasury of the Virgin Islands. This provision would effectively redirect this specific tax revenue stream from the U.S. federal government to the local government of the Virgin Islands. The amendment is slated to apply to all fuel entered into the United States from the Virgin Islands after December 31, 2024.",
