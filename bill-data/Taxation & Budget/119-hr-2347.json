    "summary": "The Survivor Justice Tax Prevention Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income damages received due to sexual acts or sexual contact, excluding punitive damages. It modifies Section 104(a)(2) to include damages from sexual acts or contact. The bill defines these terms by referencing the United States Code. It also limits substantiation requirements for these damages, prohibiting the need for medical records. The Treasury Secretary, in consultation with other agencies, is to promote public awareness of this exclusion. The amendments apply to judgments and agreements made after the bill's enactment.",
