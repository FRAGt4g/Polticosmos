    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 3363, proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by imposing a 0.125% tax on United States-bound cargo that is discharged from an ocean-going vessel in Canada or Mexico and subsequently enters the United States. This \"cargo circumvention tax\" would be paid by the importer at the time of entry. The bill defines \u201cUnited States-bound circumvented cargo\u201d and directs the Secretary to issue regulations for tax collection. The amendments would apply to cargo entering the US after December 31, 2025.",
