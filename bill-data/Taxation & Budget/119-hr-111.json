    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 111, proposes an amendment to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It aims to create a new \"above-the-line\" tax deduction, allowing individual taxpayers to deduct the costs of health insurance premiums for themselves, their spouse, and dependents from their gross income. This means the deduction would be available even to those who do not itemize. The bill specifies that any amount deducted under this provision cannot be used for any other tax deduction or credit. The proposed changes would take effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
