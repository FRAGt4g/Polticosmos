    "summary": "The 'Inaction Has Consequences Act' proposes to hold the salaries of Members of Congress in an escrow account if their respective chamber fails to pass all annual appropriation bills by the start of the fiscal year. These funds would be withheld until the chamber completes its appropriations work or until the end of the two-year congressional session, whichever comes first. This measure aims to incentivize Congress to fund the government on time, thereby preventing shutdowns and fulfilling its budgetary duties, while complying with the 27th Amendment regarding congressional pay.",
