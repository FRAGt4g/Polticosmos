    "summary": "The Lowering Costs for Caregivers Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide financial relief to individuals caring for their parents. The bill expands the definition of eligible medical expenses for tax-advantaged health accounts. It would allow taxpayers to use funds from Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), Archer MSAs, Flexible Spending Arrangements (FSAs), and Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) to pay for the medical expenses of their parents and their spouse's parents. The provisions are set to apply to expenses incurred after December 31, 2024, easing the financial burden on family caregivers.",
