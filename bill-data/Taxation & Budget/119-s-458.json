    "summary": "This bill, the Senior Citizens Tax Elimination Act, proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to eliminate the inclusion of Social Security benefits in gross income. It aims to repeal Section 86 of the code, which currently taxes these benefits. The bill also includes a provision to ensure Social Security trust funds are held harmless from any revenue loss due to this change, without resorting to tax increases.  It was introduced in the Senate by Mr. Tuberville and Mr. Sheehy.",
