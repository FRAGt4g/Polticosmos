    "summary": "The Mental Health Research Accelerator Act of 2025 proposes a tax credit for expenses related to translational research on neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric conditions. The credit is equal to 25% of eligible expenses, subject to national and individual taxpayer limitations. The bill outlines allocation procedures, emphasizes scientific merit, and encourages public-private partnerships. Tax-exempt entities can transfer the credit to eligible project partners.  Expenses eligible for the credit cannot also be used for other research credits, though they can be used in calculating future base period research expenses. The credit terminates after 2035.",
