    "summary": "The Safeguarding Charity Act (S. 1428) clarifies that tax exemptions for organizations under sections 501(c) and 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code are not considered federal financial assistance. The bill amends Title 1 of the United States Code to explicitly state this, impacting how federal laws, rules, and regulations treat these exemptions. It also includes a rule of construction to prevent the implication that past tax exemptions were federal assistance.",
