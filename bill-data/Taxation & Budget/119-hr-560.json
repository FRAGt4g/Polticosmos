    "summary": "The Second Job Tax Relief Act of 2025 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude compensation from secondary employment for certain taxpayers from income and payroll taxes.  It defines \"secondary employment compensation\" and sets eligibility requirements. A phase-out provision exists based on modified adjusted gross income. The bill also amends sections related to Social Security, unemployment, and wage withholding to reflect the exclusion and appropriates funds to offset revenue reductions. The legislation will apply to amounts earned after the date of enactment, and sunsets 5 years after that date.",
