    "summary": "The Carried Interest Fairness Act of 2025 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code to address the tax treatment of \"carried interest,\" typically earned by investment managers. The bill reclassifies certain income and gains from investment services partnership interests as ordinary income, rather than capital gains. It also introduces special rules for partnerships providing investment management services, impacting how partners report income/loss, and gain on disposition. The bill includes provisions for partnership interests transferred in connection with services provided and outlines penalties for non-compliance and includes effective dates for the changes.",
