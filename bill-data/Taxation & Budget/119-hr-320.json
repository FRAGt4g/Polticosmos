    "summary": "The \"Make Marriage Great Again Act of 2025\" (H.R. 320) aims to eliminate the federal income tax \"marriage penalty.\" The bill proposes amending the Internal Revenue Code for tax years after 2024. It would adjust the income tax brackets for married couples filing jointly to be exactly double the size of the brackets for single individuals. This structural change would ensure that a married couple's total tax liability is not greater than the combined total they would owe if they were unmarried and filing as two separate individuals.",
