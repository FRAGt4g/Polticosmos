    "summary": "This bill, introduced in the Senate, mandates that federal agencies submit zero-based budgets every six years. These budgets would require agencies to analyze current operations, consider alternatives, and rank programs by importance. Furthermore, agencies (excluding the Department of Defense and the National Nuclear Security Administration) must recommend programs for cuts or reduced appropriations, aiming for at least a 2% reduction in discretionary spending from the previous year. This initiative seeks to increase fiscal accountability and efficiency within government agencies.",
