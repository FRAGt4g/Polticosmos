    "summary": "The Halting International Relocation of Employment Act (HIRE Act) aims to disincentivize outsourcing by imposing a 25% excise tax on payments made by U.S. taxpayers to foreign entities for services benefiting U.S. consumers. It also establishes a Domestic Workforce Fund, financed by the tax revenue, to support workforce development and retraining programs, apprenticeship initiatives, and grants to states. Furthermore, the bill denies income tax deductions on outsourcing payments.",
