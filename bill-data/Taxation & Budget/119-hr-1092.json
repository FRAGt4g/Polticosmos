    "summary": "The Responsible Budgeting Act (HR 1092) proposes changes to how the debt limit is handled. It aims to automatically increase the debt limit upon adoption of a budget resolution, and outlines procedures for presidential requests to raise the debt ceiling if Congress fails to pass a budget. The bill sets out expedited procedures in both the House and Senate for considering resolutions related to the debt limit, and also introduces procedures for the consideration of proposals to reduce the debt. The bill also amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. ",
