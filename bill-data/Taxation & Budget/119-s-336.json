    "summary": "The Disaster Mitigation and Tax Parity Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income amounts received from state-based catastrophe loss mitigation programs. These programs aim to help property owners make improvements to their property to reduce damage from windstorms, earthquakes, floods, or wildfires. The bill applies retroactively to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, and allows individuals to claim the exclusion, including via amended returns.",
