    "summary": "The CBO Scoring Accountability Act mandates the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to annually analyze the impact of major legislation for the first 10 years after enactment. This includes estimating costs, revenue changes, and comparing them to previous estimates. The CBO must report discrepancies exceeding 10% and explain their cause. The bill defines \"major legislation\" and requires federal agencies to assist the CBO in its analysis. It aims to increase transparency of the long-term effects of major legislation.",
