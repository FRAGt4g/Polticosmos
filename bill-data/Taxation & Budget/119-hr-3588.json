    "summary": "The Real Estate Reciprocity Act aims to regulate foreign investment in U.S. real estate. It mandates reporting of real estate purchases by non-citizens to the IRS, imposes a 50% tax on real estate acquisitions by 'disqualified persons' (citizens of countries that restrict U.S. citizens' property ownership, entities domiciled in those countries, and entities controlled by them), with some exceptions. It also requires a report from the Secretary of State on countries prohibiting U.S. citizen property ownership.",
