    "summary": "The Simplify Automatic Filing Extensions Act (SAFE Act) amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to protect individuals from penalties for failing to pay income tax on time.  It allows individuals to avoid penalties if they pay 125% of their prior year's tax liability by the tax payment deadline, provided certain conditions are met, such as timely filing a tax return and adherence to other stipulations. These changes apply to tax years starting after December 31, 2024.",
