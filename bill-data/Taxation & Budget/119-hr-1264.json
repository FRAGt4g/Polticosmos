    "summary": "The USA Batteries Act aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to eliminate lead oxide, antimony, and sulfuric acid from Superfund excise taxes. The bill argues that these taxes disadvantage American battery manufacturers, making them less competitive compared to imported batteries. It highlights the economic impact and sustainability of the lead battery industry and its critical role in various sectors. The bill seeks to remove these chemicals from the taxable list to boost the domestic industry.",
