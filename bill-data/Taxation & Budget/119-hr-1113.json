    "summary": "The Race Horse Cost Recovery Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a 3-year depreciation period for all race horses. This means that owners of race horses can deduct the cost of their horses over a shorter period than currently allowed, potentially reducing their tax liability. The bill applies to property placed in service after December 31, 2022.",
