    "summary": "The Rent Relief Act of 2025 proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide a refundable tax credit for rent paid on a taxpayer's principal residence. The credit is calculated based on the taxpayer's gross income and the amount of rent exceeding 30% of that income, with the credit amount determined by a graduated schedule. The bill also establishes a program for advance monthly payments of the credit and includes conforming and clerical amendments. The effective date for the changes is for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.",
