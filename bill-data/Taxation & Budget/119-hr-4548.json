    "summary": "The Small Nonprofit Retirement Security Act of 2025 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide tax credits for small, tax-exempt employers that offer retirement plans. This includes making the credit for small employer pension plan startup costs and the retirement auto-enrollment credit available to these organizations. The bill also includes provisions for payroll tax credits and specifies an effective date of taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. Additionally, it addresses the transfer of funds to the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Trust Fund to compensate for the revenue reduction.",
