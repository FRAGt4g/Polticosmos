This aims to reduce the tax burden on investments, particularly for assets held for more than three years, by adjusting the basis of those assets for inflation. It defines \u201cindexed assets,\u201d outlines rules for determining the \u201cindexed basis,\u201d and addresses exceptions, including for corporations, regulated investment companies, and other pass-through entities. The amendments apply to assets acquired after December 31, 2025.",
