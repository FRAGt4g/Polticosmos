    "summary": "This bill, the Growing and Preserving Innovation in America Act of 2025, aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Specifically, it seeks to repeal a scheduled reduction in the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income. The bill, introduced by Mr. Feenstra, would maintain the deduction at 37.5% instead of allowing it to decrease to a lower percentage. The amendment made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.",
