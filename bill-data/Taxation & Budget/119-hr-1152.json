    "summary": "The Electronic Filing and Payment Fairness Act aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It seeks to apply the \"mailbox rule\" to electronic submissions to the IRS, meaning that the date of electronic submission of tax documents and payments is considered the date of delivery or payment, regardless of when the IRS receives or processes them. The Act also mandates the Secretary of the Treasury issue regulations by December 31, 2025, to implement this change, with the amendments applying to documents and payments sent after December 31, 2025.",
