    "summary": "The Family Business Legacy Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an estate tax deduction for bequests to certain tax-exempt organizations (specifically those under section 501(c)(4), (5), or (6)). This aims to reduce the value of taxable estates by excluding these charitable contributions. The bill details the requirements, including handling of powers of appointment and death taxes, and sets the effective date for estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2025.",
