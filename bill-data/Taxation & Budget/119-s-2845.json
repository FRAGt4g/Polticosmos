It aims to require billionaires to pay taxes annually, modify over 30 tax provisions, and close loopholes related to strategies like 'buy, borrow, die.' The bill covers various aspects, including eliminating tax deferral, defining 'applicable taxpayers,' and modifying rules for applicable entities, trusts, deferred compensation, and certain investments.",
