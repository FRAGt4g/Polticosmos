    "summary": "The 'Supporting Transit Commutes Act' (H.R. 409) proposes amending the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers to take a tax deduction for the cost of providing certain transportation fringe benefits, such as transit passes and vanpool services. This bill would restore a deduction that was previously eliminated. Under the act, employers could deduct the full cost of these benefits up to the statutory limit. However, the deduction would be reduced to 50% if the benefit is offered as part of a salary reduction agreement where an employee chooses between the benefit and cash. The legislation aims to incentivize employers to support employee commutes via public transit.",
