    "summary": "The Taxpayer Protection Act aims to prevent the executive branch from penalizing states that contribute more in federal income taxes than they receive in federal funding (donor states). It prohibits general funding prohibitions and unwarranted revocations or suspensions of existing agreements with such states. The bill establishes a Donor State Protection Trust Fund, funded by tax revenue from donor states, to compensate states affected by prohibited actions. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to create and manage this trust fund.",
