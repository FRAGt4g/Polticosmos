    "summary": "The 'Modernizing Agricultural and Manufacturing Bonds Act' amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It modifies rules for qualified small issue manufacturing bonds to include production of intangible property and expands functionally related facilities. The bill increases limitations on bond amounts and adjusts them for inflation. It also expands exceptions to private activity bond rules for first-time farmers, increasing dollar limitations, repealing a lower dollar limit on used farm equipment, and basing substantial farmland determination on average farm size. The amendments apply to obligations and bonds issued after specific dates.",
