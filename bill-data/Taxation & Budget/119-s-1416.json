    "summary": "The bill, titled the \"Reduction of Excess Business Holding Accrual Act,\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding the tax on private foundation excess business holdings. It focuses on how employee-owned stock purchased by a business enterprise through certain employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) is treated. Specifically, it specifies that certain repurchased employee-owned stock by a business should be considered outstanding stock, but only up to a 49% holding limit, to determine excess business holdings. This change applies to taxable years ending after the bill's enactment and helps determine tax liabilities.",
