    "summary": "Introduced by Representatives Nehls and Boebert, H.R. 446, the \"Endowment Tax Fairness Act,\" proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The bill seeks to significantly increase the excise tax rate on the net investment income of certain private colleges and universities from the current 1.4 percent to 21 percent. The legislation specifies that the additional revenue generated from this tax hike shall be deposited in the Treasury's general fund and used to reduce the national deficit and, subsequently, the national debt. The change would apply to taxable years following the bill's enactment.",
