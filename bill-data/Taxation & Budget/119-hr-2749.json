    "summary": "This bill proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a refundable tax credit for home accessibility improvements. This credit would cover 35% of qualified expenses up to $10,000 per year and $30,000 total, subject to income limitations. The bill defines qualified individuals and improvements, including ramps, grab bars, widening doorways, and modifications for vision impairment. It also mandates guidance from the Treasury on additional improvements. A GAO study will evaluate the credit's effectiveness, making recommendations for future improvements. The amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
