    "summary": "The Creating Hospitality Economic Enhancement for Restaurants and Servers Act (CHEERS Act) amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to incentivize the use of energy-efficient kegs in restaurants, bars, and entertainment venues. The bill classifies qualified energy-efficient draft property (stainless steel or aluminum kegs and related equipment) as energy-efficient commercial building property, allowing for a tax deduction. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to issue regulations to implement the provision, which would be effective for property placed in service after December 31, 2024.",
