    "summary": "Introduced by Rep. Smith of Nebraska, the \"Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act\" (H.R. 196) proposes to rescind, or cancel, certain unobligated funds previously appropriated to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The bill specifically targets money made available by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for various IRS activities, including taxpayer services, enforcement, operations support, and business systems modernization. In effect, the legislation seeks to defund a significant portion of the increased budget granted to the IRS under the prior act, making those funds unavailable for future use.",
