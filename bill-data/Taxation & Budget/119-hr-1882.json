    "summary": "The \"Saving Gig Economy Taxpayers Act\" aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It seeks to reinstate an exception for de minimis payments made by third-party settlement organizations, specifically regarding reporting requirements for payment card and third-party network transactions. Essentially, it raises the threshold for when these organizations must report transactions to the IRS, aligning with pre-American Rescue Plan Act regulations. Additionally, it addresses how these thresholds apply with backup withholding rules.",
