    "summary": "The Homes Over Middle-Class Exploitation Schemes Act (HOMES Act) amends the Internal Revenue Code to disallow interest and depreciation deductions for taxpayers who own 50 or more single-family residential rental properties. This aims to curb large-scale real estate investors. Exceptions are provided for sales to individuals for primary residences or to qualified nonprofit organizations.  The bill also defines relevant terms (like 'disqualified single family property owner' and 'single family residential rental property') and includes effective date provisions.",
