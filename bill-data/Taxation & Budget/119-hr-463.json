    "summary": "This bill, the \"Lower Your Taxes Act,\" proposes major amendments to the Internal Revenue Code. It significantly expands the Earned Income Tax Credit and establishes a new, larger, fully refundable Child Tax Credit, to be distributed as monthly advance payments to families. It also creates a federal program to refund the value of non-refundable state EITCs. To fund these changes and reduce the national deficit, the bill increases taxes on corporations by raising the corporate income tax rate, the stock buyback tax, and the corporate minimum tax. It also eliminates preferential capital gains tax rates for individuals with incomes over $1 million.",
