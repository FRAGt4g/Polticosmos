    "summary": "The Veterans Jobs Opportunity Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a tax credit for veteran-owned small businesses that start up in underserved communities. The credit is 15% of qualified start-up expenditures, up to $50,000. The bill defines key terms like \"applicable veteran-owned small business\", \"qualified start-up expenditures\", \"underserved community\", and \"veteran or spouse of veteran.\" It also includes special rules related to election of the credit, controlled groups, and basis reduction. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration must report on the credit every four years, and the amendments apply to taxable years beginning after the bill's enactment.",
