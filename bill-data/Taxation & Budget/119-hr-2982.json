    "summary": "This bill, the \"Fair Taxation of Digital Assets in Puerto Rico Act of 2025,\" aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It modifies the sourcing rules for digital asset income of Puerto Rican residents. Specifically, it specifies that income from activities like digital asset mining, staking, holding, or selling is *not* considered derived from sources within Puerto Rico for tax purposes. This would apply to individuals described in section 933. The Act defines \"digital asset\" and specifies a financial interest in such is treated similarly. The changes would apply to taxable years beginning after the Act's enactment.",
