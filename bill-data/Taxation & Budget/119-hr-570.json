    "summary": "This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow the child tax credit for stillbirths. It defines stillbirth as a delivery after spontaneous intrauterine fetal demise after 20 weeks of gestation. The bill outlines specific rules for claiming the credit, treating the unborn child as if they died immediately after delivery for tax purposes. It aims to provide financial support to families experiencing this loss.",
