    "summary": "The Freedom for Families Act proposes major changes to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) by amending the Internal Revenue Code. It would allow individuals to make tax-free withdrawals for any reason during periods of FMLA-qualified family or medical leave. The bill also removes the requirement for an individual to have a high-deductible health plan to be eligible for an HSA. Additionally, it substantially increases the annual contribution limit to $9,000 for individuals and $18,000 for joint filers, aiming to increase the flexibility and accessibility of these accounts for American families.",
