    "summary": "The Unfair Tax Prevention Act (HR 2423) amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the application of the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT). It introduces special rules for foreign-owned entities connected to jurisdictions with extraterritorial taxes. For these entities, it alters how they are classified for BEAT, modifies the application of certain BEAT provisions, and treats a portion of their cost of goods sold as a base erosion tax benefit. The Act aims to address tax implications related to foreign-owned entities operating in countries with specific tax regimes, as defined by the bill.",
