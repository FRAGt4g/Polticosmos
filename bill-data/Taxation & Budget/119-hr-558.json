    "summary": "The Tip Tax Termination Act proposes amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt a portion of certain tipped wages from income tax for five years. Specifically, it excludes up to $20,000 of eligible tips, received in industries like hospitality and food service, from gross income. This exclusion does not impact deductions or credits, except for the child tax credit and earned income credit. The changes are set to expire at the end of 2029, with modifications for tax withholding procedures, and its effective date being December 31, 2024.",
