    "summary": "The Flood Insurance Relief Act proposes amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow individuals to deduct qualified flood insurance premiums from their gross income. This new deduction is subject to an income limitation; taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes exceeding $200,000 (or $400,000 for joint filers) are ineligible. The bill defines \"qualified flood insurance premiums\" to include premiums paid under the National Flood Insurance Act, private flood insurance, and related fees and surcharges. The bill also makes conforming amendments to other sections of the IRS code.",
