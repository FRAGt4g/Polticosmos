    "summary": "H.R. 332, the \u201cTravel Trailer and Camper Tax Parity Act,\u201d proposes an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The bill seeks to expand the definition of \u201cfloor plan financing\u201d to include financing for travel trailers and campers designed for temporary recreational, camping, or seasonal use. This change would allow businesses that sell these vehicles to fully deduct their interest expenses, providing them with the same tax treatment as motor vehicle dealerships. The amendment is intended to apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
