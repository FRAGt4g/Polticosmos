    "summary": "The Territorial Tax Parity Act of 2025 (H.R. 365) aims to foster economic recovery in U.S. possessions by amending the Internal Revenue Code. The bill modifies tax source rules, specifying that certain income from these territories is only considered U.S.-sourced if it's attributable to a fixed office or place of business within the U.S. This change, along with an update to rules for personal property sales, is intended to encourage investment and business activity within the territories by creating a more favorable tax environment, effective for taxable years after December 31, 2024.",
