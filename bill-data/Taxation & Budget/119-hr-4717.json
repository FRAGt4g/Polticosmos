    "summary": "This bill, the First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit Act of 2025, amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a refundable tax credit for first-time homebuyers. The credit is 10% of the purchase price, capped at $15,000 (or $7,500 for married filing separately). It includes limitations based on income and purchase price, and an inflation adjustment. It defines key terms like \"first-time homebuyer\" and \"principal residence,\" establishes recapture provisions, and allows for the credit to be transferred to the mortgage lender. It also amends the IRS code to treat certain errors related to the credit as mathematical or clerical errors, and specifies an effective date.",
