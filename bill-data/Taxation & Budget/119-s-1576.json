    "summary": "The 'Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act' amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restrict the deduction of excessive employee remuneration. It broadens the definition of 'covered individual' to include former high-ranking officers and those highly compensated. It also modifies the definition of a publicly held corporation and grants the Secretary the authority to issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of these provisions. The changes apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
