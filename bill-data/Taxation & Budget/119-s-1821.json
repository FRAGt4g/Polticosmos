    "summary": "The 'Tackling Predatory Litigation Funding Act' (S. 1821) amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a tax on income from litigation received by third-party entities that finance litigation. It defines key terms like 'covered party,' 'litigation financing agreement,' and 'qualified litigation proceeds.' The bill also includes withholding requirements for litigation proceeds and excludes financial arrangements/proceeds from such financing from the definition of a capital asset.  The amendments would apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.",
