    "summary": "The \"Combating High Inflation Limiting Daycare Act of 2025\" (CHILD Act) is a bipartisan bill that amends the Internal Revenue Code to address rising childcare costs. It proposes doubling the maximum annual pre-tax contribution for dependent care assistance programs from $5,000 to $10,000 for most families. The bill also introduces a cost-of-living adjustment, indexing this limit to inflation for future years, with the changes effective for calendar years after 2024. The goal is to provide financial relief to working families struggling with the high cost of daycare.",
