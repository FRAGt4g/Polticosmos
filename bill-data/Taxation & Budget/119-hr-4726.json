    "summary": "The Educational Toy Tax Relief Act aims to prohibit the imposition of duties on certain baby toy items, specifically those for children under three, tricycles, playpens, baby swings, and educational toys. It references the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and dictates that the President cannot impose such duties under IEEPA and must terminate any existing duties on these items. Furthermore, any substantially similar duties imposed under other authorities are rendered ineffective.",
