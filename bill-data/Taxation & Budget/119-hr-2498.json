    "summary": "The 'End Dark Money Act' aims to increase transparency in political activity of certain non-profit organizations. It seeks to repeal a restriction on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that limited its ability to oversee the political activities of these organizations. The bill references a specific section of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act from 2024 and nullifies its effect for fiscal year 2025. This allows the IRS to scrutinize such nonprofits.",
