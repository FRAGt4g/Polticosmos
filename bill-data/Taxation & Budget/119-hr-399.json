    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 399, introduced by Mrs. Radewagen, seeks to make the American Samoa economic development tax credit permanent. It proposes amending the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 to remove the existing expiration date of January 1, 2022. This would make the tax credit a permanent incentive intended to support economic development in American Samoa. The legislation is designed to be effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, ensuring continuous support for the territory's economy.",
