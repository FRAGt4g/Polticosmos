    "summary": "The bill, titled the Share Holder Allocation for Rewards to Employees Plan Act (SHARE Plan Act), aims to incentivize corporations to distribute equity to their employees. It proposes a reduced corporate tax rate for companies meeting specific criteria, including having a SHARE plan, a minimum number of employees, and a certain 'SHARE ratio' demonstrating equity distribution. The bill also excludes stock received under a SHARE plan from an employee's gross income. These provisions are intended to promote employee ownership and benefit workforce development, and job creation.",
