    "summary": "This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish procedures for attributing errors in payroll tax filings when third-party payors are involved. It defines the responsibilities of employers and third-party payors regarding liabilities arising from errors, differentiating based on whether the payor had 'constructive knowledge' of an issue. The bill also specifies record retention requirements and clarifies when a third-party payor is deemed not to have constructive knowledge. The effective date is tied to audits, examinations, and assessments made after enactment.",
