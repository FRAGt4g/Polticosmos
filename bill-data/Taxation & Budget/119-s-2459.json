    "summary": "The ABLE Employment Flexibility Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers to contribute to ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) accounts in lieu of retirement plan contributions for eligible ABLE individuals. This aims to prevent these individuals from losing benefits due to retirement plan rules. The bill also clarifies employer contributions to ABLE programs, treats contributions as made by the beneficiary, and directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations and publications regarding these changes. The changes will be effective starting after the enactment of the Act.",
