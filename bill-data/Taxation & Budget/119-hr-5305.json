    "summary": "The Congressional Money Returned to America Act (or Congressional MRA Act) mandates that any unspent funds from the Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) at the end of a fiscal year be deposited into the Treasury. These funds are then to be used for deficit reduction or, if no deficit exists, to reduce the federal debt. The Committee on House Administration will create regulations to implement the act, which applies starting in fiscal year 2026.",
