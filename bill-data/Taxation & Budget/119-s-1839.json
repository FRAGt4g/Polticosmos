    "summary": "This bill, the Generating Retirement Ownership through Long-Term Holding Act, amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow individuals to defer recognition of reinvested capital gains distributions from regulated investment companies. Specifically, it introduces a new section (1046) that allows for nonrecognition of gain upon reinvestment, but requires recognition upon sale or redemption of the shares, or upon the individual's death. It also includes conforming amendments to other sections of the code and specifies an effective date for the changes.",
