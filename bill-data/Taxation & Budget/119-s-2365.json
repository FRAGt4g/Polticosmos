    "summary": "The Small Nonprofit Retirement Security Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code to expand access to retirement credits for small, tax-exempt employers like non-profits. It allows these organizations to claim credits for pension plan startup costs and auto-enrollment, effectively offsetting payroll tax burdens. The bill also includes provisions to reimburse the Social Security Trust Funds for revenue lost due to these new tax credits, ensuring funds are available for payouts. The amendments apply to tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
