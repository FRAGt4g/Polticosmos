    "summary": "The 'No Deductions for Marijuana Businesses Act' (H.R. 1447) amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to maintain the prohibition on allowing any deduction or credit for businesses involved in trafficking marijuana. This means businesses dealing in marijuana (as defined by the Controlled Substances Act) cannot deduct expenses related to their operations for federal tax purposes. The bill seeks to clarify and potentially strengthen existing tax regulations regarding marijuana businesses.",
