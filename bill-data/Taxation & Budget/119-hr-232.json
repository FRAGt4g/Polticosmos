    "summary": "Introduced as H.R. 232, the \"SALT Fairness and Marriage Penalty Elimination Act\" proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code to significantly increase the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The bill would raise the current deduction limit from $10,000 to $100,000 for most individual filers. It also aims to eliminate the marriage penalty in the current law by setting a new, higher limit of $200,000 for married couples filing a joint return. The proposed changes would apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
