    "summary": "The 'Putting Trust in Transparency Act' aims to increase transparency regarding the sources of funding for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that receive federal funds. The bill proposes amending the Internal Revenue Code to mandate the public disclosure of names, zip codes, and total contributions of donors to 501(c) organizations that receive federal funding, as reported on Schedule B of Form 990. It also outlines the consequences, including revocation of tax-exempt status, for organizations that fail to comply with the disclosure requirements.",
