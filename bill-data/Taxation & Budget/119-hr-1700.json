    "summary": "The Social Security Expansion Act proposes several changes to the Social Security program. Key provisions include an across-the-board benefit increase, adjustments to cost-of-living calculations (using the Consumer Price Index for Elderly Consumers), and an increase in the minimum benefit for long-term low earners. The bill also extends benefit eligibility for full-time student children, modifies payroll and self-employment taxes, and establishes a consolidated Social Security Trust Fund. It makes a series of conforming amendments related to the new trust fund structure.",
