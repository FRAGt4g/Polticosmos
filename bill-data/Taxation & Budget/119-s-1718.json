    "summary": "The Invest America Act (S. 1718) proposes to create Invest America accounts, tax-advantaged savings accounts designed for investment in specific mutual funds or ETFs, primarily tracking the S&P 500. It sets a contribution limit of $5,000 per year, adjustable for inflation. The bill also mandates federal contributions of $1,000 to eligible individuals (U.S. citizens born after July 4, 2026, with a U.S. citizen parent). It amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish these accounts, defining eligible investments and outlining distribution rules. Distributions are taxed as ordinary income, but it amends 1(h)(12) to tax distributions from the Invest America account as net capital gain.",
