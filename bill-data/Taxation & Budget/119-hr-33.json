    "summary": "This bill establishes a two-part framework to address double taxation between the United States and Taiwan. Title I, the \"United States-Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act,\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce U.S. tax rates on income earned by qualified Taiwanese residents, contingent on Taiwan providing reciprocal benefits. Title II, the \"United States-Taiwan Tax Agreement Authorization Act,\" authorizes the President to negotiate a more comprehensive bilateral tax agreement with Taiwan. It creates a special legislative process for approving this agreement, bypassing the standard treaty process due to Taiwan's unique political status.",
