    "summary": "The 'Paying a Fair Share Act of 2025' proposes an additional tax on high-income earners (those with adjusted gross income over $1,000,000, adjusted for inflation). The tax, a percentage of income exceeding a threshold, is calculated after considering regular tax liability, specified taxes, and certain credits. The bill also includes a 'sense of the Senate' regarding broader tax reform and its potential to eliminate loopholes and ensure fairer taxation for the wealthy. The changes apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2024.",
