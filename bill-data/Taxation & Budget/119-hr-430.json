    "summary": "Introduced by a bipartisan group of representatives, H.R. 430, the 'SALT Deductibility Act,' proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The bill aims to repeal the current limitation on the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), which is presently capped at $10,000 per household. If passed, taxpayers would once again be able to deduct the full amount of their state and local income and property taxes from their federal taxable income. The proposed change would apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
