    "summary": "The National Taxpayer Advocate Enhancement Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow the National Taxpayer Advocate to directly appoint counsel within their office. This is to align with the original intent of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, as outlined in the conference report. The act aims to clarify the Advocate's authority and streamline legal support within the office.",
