    "summary": "The Interstate Commerce Simplification Act of 2025 (H.R. 427) seeks to amend Public Law 86-272, which limits the ability of states to impose income tax on out-of-state businesses. The bill proposes expanding the definition of \"solicitation of orders\" to include any business activity that facilitates these solicitations, even if that activity serves an independent business function. This change would broaden the legal protection for businesses engaged in interstate commerce, shielding more of their activities from state-level taxation and aiming to simplify tax compliance across state lines.",
