    "summary": "The Baby Sleep Tax Relief Act aims to prohibit the imposition of duties on specific baby sleep items, such as cribs, beds, mattresses, and monitors, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The bill dictates that the President cannot impose such duties and must terminate any existing ones on these items. It also addresses duties imposed under other authorities, ensuring they don't mirror the prohibited duties. The bill is sponsored by multiple representatives and referred to committees on Ways and Means and Foreign Affairs.",
