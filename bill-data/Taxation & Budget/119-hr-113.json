    "summary": "The \u201cBudget Process Enhancement Act\u201d proposes two key changes to federal budgeting. First, it amends the budget baseline calculation to remove automatic adjustments for inflation. Second, it introduces accountability measures by placing Members of Congress' salaries in escrow if their respective chamber fails to pass a budget resolution by the April 15 deadline. It also mandates that top Office of Management and Budget officials will not receive pay for any period during which the President's budget is submitted late to Congress, with no retroactive payment allowed.",
