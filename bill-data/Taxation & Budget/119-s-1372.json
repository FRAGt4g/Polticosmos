    "summary": "The 'Tax Cut for Workers Act of 2025' amends the Internal Revenue Code to expand and make permanent modifications to the earned income credit. Key changes include lowering the minimum age for the credit, eliminating the maximum age, increasing credit and phaseout percentages and amounts, and adjusting for inflation. It also extends the credit to US possessions and allows taxpayers to use prior year's earned income if it's higher. The amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.",
