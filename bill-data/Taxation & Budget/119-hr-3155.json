    "summary": "The Child Care for American Families Act (H.R. 3155) aims to enhance the employer-provided child care credit within the Internal Revenue Code. It increases the credit amount, with varying percentages based on business size and location (including eligible areas like rural counties). It also changes dollar limitations and mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a public awareness program. The bill calls for a GAO study on regulatory barriers affecting employer-provided child care and offers recommendations to congressional committees.",
