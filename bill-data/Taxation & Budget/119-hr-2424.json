    "summary": "The 'Modern, Clean, and Safe Trucks Act of 2025' proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the 12% federal excise tax on heavy trucks and trailers. The bill argues this tax discourages the use of newer, more environmentally friendly vehicles. It highlights the environmental and economic benefits of modern trucks and aims to make transportation cleaner, safer, and more affordable for businesses and consumers. The bill's proponents believe that repealing the tax will promote job growth and support the transition to cleaner transportation technologies, as well as help with Highway Trust Fund funding.",
