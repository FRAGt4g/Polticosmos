    "summary": "The Rare Earth Magnet Security Act of 2025 proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to incentivize the domestic production of high-performance rare earth magnets. It introduces a tax credit based on the number of magnets produced and sold, with an enhanced credit for those using domestically sourced rare earth materials. The bill includes definitions, phase-out provisions, sourcing restrictions regarding non-allied foreign nations, and special rules. It also allows for elective payments, makes the credit part of the general business credit, and provides for conforming amendments, with the changes applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
