    "summary": "This bill, the FAIR PREP Act of 2025, amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restrict the Secretary of the Treasury from preparing tax returns, essentially prohibiting the IRS from offering a free, direct e-file tax return service. It carves out exceptions for the IRS Free File Program and qualified return preparation programs. The bill also limits future government spending on developing or operating such electronic tax preparation services unless explicitly authorized by law.  The aim is to protect the role of private tax preparers.",
