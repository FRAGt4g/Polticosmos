    "summary": "The Independent Programmers Tax Incentive Act (HR 2230) proposes tax credits for multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) that carry independent programmers.  The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit based on license fees paid to qualified independent programmers, with a cap determined by subscriber count. It also mandates biennial reports from the FCC to Congress on the distribution of independent programming and allows the FCC access to tax return information for this purpose.",
