    "summary": "This bill, the Secure U.S. Leadership in Space Act of 2025, amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat spaceports similarly to airports for the purposes of exempt facility bond rules. This includes defining spaceports, specifying their permitted uses (manufacturing, launch/reentry services, crew transfer), and outlining bond-related exceptions. It aims to encourage spaceport development by offering tax advantages and clarifying related financial regulations, thus promoting the U.S. space industry.",
