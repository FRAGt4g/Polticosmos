    "summary": "The Balanced Budget Accountability Act aims to incentivize Congress to pass balanced budgets. If a balanced budget isn't certified by the Office of Management and Budget by April 16th of each year, congressional salaries are affected. For fiscal years 2026 and 2027, salaries are held in escrow. Starting in 2028, and subsequent years, pay is reduced. Furthermore, the bill mandates a three-fifths supermajority vote in both houses of Congress for any legislation that increases revenue.",
