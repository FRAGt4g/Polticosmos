    "summary": "The 'Barcode Automation for Revenue Collection to Organize Disbursement and Enhance Efficiency Act' (BARCODE Efficiency Act) mandates the use of scannable codes on electronically prepared tax returns filed on paper. The bill requires the IRS to use barcode scanning and optical character recognition (OCR) technology to digitize paper tax returns and correspondence. Exceptions are allowed if the technology proves less efficient than manual transcription, with reports to Congress required. The effective dates for implementation vary based on the type of tax form.",
