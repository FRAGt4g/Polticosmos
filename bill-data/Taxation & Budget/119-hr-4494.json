    "summary": "The Flood Insurance Relief Act amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an above-the-line deduction for qualified flood insurance premiums paid by individuals. This deduction is subject to an income limitation, disallowing it for taxpayers with adjusted gross income exceeding $200,000 ($400,000 for joint filers). The qualified premiums include those for coverage under the National Flood Insurance Act and private flood insurance, as well as associated fees and surcharges. Conforming amendments are also made to the code. The changes apply to taxable years beginning after the Act's enactment.",
