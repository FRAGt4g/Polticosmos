    "summary": "The Disaster Reforestation Act amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a special rule for casualty losses of uncut timber. It stipulates that the basis for deducting such losses, resulting from fire, storm, theft, or other casualties, must not be less than the appraised value of the timber before the loss minus its salvage value. The bill details appraisal methods, includes a provision for estimated losses, excludes timber not held for sale, and mandates reforestation within five years to qualify for the deduction, with potential recapture for non-compliance. The bill also specifies that other casualties can include wood-destroying insects, wood-destroying invasive species, or severe drought.",
