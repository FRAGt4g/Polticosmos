    "summary": "This bill, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act of 2025, aims to prevent government shutdowns by automatically providing continuing appropriations when regular appropriation bills are not enacted. It amends Title 31 of the United States Code to outline the process for funding federal programs, projects, and activities at a reduced rate of operations during a lapse in appropriations. The bill specifies the calculation of these reduced rates, conditions, and duration of the funding, ensuring vital services continue to operate even in the absence of a budget.",
