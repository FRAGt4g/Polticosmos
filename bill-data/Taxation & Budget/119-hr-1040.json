    "summary": "The Senior Citizens Tax Elimination Act (H.R. 1040) aims to eliminate the inclusion of Social Security benefits in gross income, effectively removing federal income tax on these benefits. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It includes a provision to ensure that Social Security trust funds are held harmless from the loss of revenue resulting from this change, and it expresses the sense of Congress that tax increases won't be used to cover the loss. The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on February 6, 2025.",
