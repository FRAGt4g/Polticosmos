    "summary": "The Water Conservation Rebate Tax Parity Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to expand tax exclusions for subsidies related to water conservation, storm water management, and wastewater management. It allows exemptions for subsidies provided by utilities, state, and local governments for installing qualifying measures in residential properties. The bill defines related terms and clarifies the effective date and scope of the amendments, ensuring the changes apply from January 1, 2022 onwards, and explicitly states any previous tax treatments are not changed.",
