    "summary": "The 'Stop the Nosy Obsession with Online Payments Act of 2025' (SNOOP Act of 2025) aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It primarily focuses on reinstating the exception for de minimis payments by third-party settlement organizations, as it existed before the American Rescue Plan Act. This change raises the reporting threshold for these organizations, requiring reporting only if payments exceed $20,000 and the number of transactions exceeds 200. The bill also applies the de minimis rule to backup withholding for third-party network transactions, impacting when such transactions are considered reportable.",
