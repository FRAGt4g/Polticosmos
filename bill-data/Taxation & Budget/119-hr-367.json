    "summary": "H.R. 367, the 'Territorial Tax Parity and Clarification Act,' proposes an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The bill aims to modify the tax 'source rules' that determine where income from the sale of personal property in U.S. possessions is earned for tax purposes. It specifically amends Section 865(j)(3) to align the tax treatment for possessions covered under Section 932 (U.S. Virgin Islands) with those under Section 931. This change seeks to create greater tax parity and clarity among the territories, effective for taxable years after December 31, 2023.",
