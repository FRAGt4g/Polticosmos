    "summary": "This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a tax credit for small businesses that install diaper changing stations in their restrooms. The credit equals 70% of qualified expenses, capped at $10,000 per business location, and requires restrooms accessible to both men and women.  It defines eligible small businesses based on gross receipts or employee count and ensures no double benefits for expenses covered by the credit. The amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.",
