    "summary": "The CBP SPACE Act amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to allow the rate of merchandise processing fees to be adjusted to offset capital costs for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). It expands the use of fee proceeds to include capital costs related to passenger inspection services. The bill prohibits CBP from requiring seaports to provide or maintain certain facilities. It mandates an annual report to congressional committees detailing fee proceeds and expenditures. Essentially, it aims to provide CBP more financial flexibility for infrastructure and equipment upgrades while increasing oversight.",
