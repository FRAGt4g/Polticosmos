    "summary": "The 'Territorial Tax Parity and Fairness Act' (H.R. 368) amends the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. It proposes that bona fide residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands who are shareholders in local Virgin Islands corporations will not be treated as 'United States persons' for specific tax purposes. This change exempts them from certain anti-deferral tax rules that apply to U.S. owners of foreign corporations. The bill aims to ensure that income from these local corporations is sourced and taxed within the Virgin Islands, promoting tax fairness and potentially stimulating the territory's economy.",
