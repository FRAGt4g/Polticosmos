    "summary": "The 'No Tax Breaks for Outsourcing Act' amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to address tax implications of international business activities. It focuses on several key areas including current year inclusion of net CFC tested income, country-by-country application of foreign tax credits, limitations on interest deductions for international financial reporting groups, modifications relating to inverted corporations, and the treatment of foreign corporations managed and controlled in the U.S. as domestic corporations. The bill aims to close tax loopholes and potentially increase tax revenue.",
