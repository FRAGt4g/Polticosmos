Key provisions include: raising the wage base subject to Social Security taxes, introducing an additional hospital insurance tax on high-income earners on both wages and self-employment income, modifying the tax on net investment income, and allocating a portion of the increased tax revenue to the Old-Age and Survivors, Disability Insurance, and Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Funds. The changes primarily impact high-income taxpayers and are effective on or after January 1, 2026.",
