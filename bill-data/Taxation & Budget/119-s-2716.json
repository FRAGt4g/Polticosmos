    "summary": "The 'You Earned It, You Keep It Act' primarily focuses on Social Security reform. It proposes repealing the inclusion of Social Security benefits in gross income, with associated appropriations to maintain trust funds. The bill also modifies how wages and self-employment income are calculated for Social Security tax purposes, including new limitations, and introduces rules for multiple employers. Furthermore, it amends the Social Security benefit formula to include earnings over $250,000 in determining primary insurance amounts. Finally, it includes provisions to hold certain beneficiaries harmless, and sets effective dates for these changes.",
