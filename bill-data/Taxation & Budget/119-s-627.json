    "summary": "This bill, known as the Ensuring Nationwide Access to a Better Life Experience Act (ENABLE Act), amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make certain provisions related to ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) programs permanent. It removes the expiration date on increased contributions to ABLE accounts and modifies the definition of qualified retirement savings contributions to include ABLE contributions. The legislation also makes permanent the ability to roll over funds from 529 education savings plans to ABLE accounts. These changes aim to improve access to and the benefits of ABLE programs.",
