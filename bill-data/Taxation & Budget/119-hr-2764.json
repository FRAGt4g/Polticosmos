Key provisions include lowering the minimum age for the credit, eliminating the maximum age, increasing credit and phaseout percentages and amounts, and adjusting for inflation. It also addresses the application of the credit to U.S. possessions and allows for the use of prior year earned income in certain circumstances. The changes are effective for the 2026 tax year.",
