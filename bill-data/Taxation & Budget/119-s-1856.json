    "summary": "This bill, S. 1856, introduced in the Senate on May 22, 2025, aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The core of the bill proposes excluding military bonuses from gross income, allowing these payments to be tax-free.

This change would apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
