    "summary": "The Historic Tax Credit Growth and Opportunity Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to enhance the historic rehabilitation tax credit. Key provisions include allowing the full credit in the year a building is placed in service, increasing the credit for certain small projects (and providing a higher credit for rural projects), enabling the transfer of the credit for small projects, expanding the types of buildings eligible for rehabilitation, eliminating basis adjustment for the credit, and modifying rules for tax-exempt use property. These changes aim to incentivize historic preservation and economic development.",
