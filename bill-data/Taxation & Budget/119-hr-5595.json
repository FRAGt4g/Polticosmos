    "summary": "The REMIT Act (H.R. 5595) amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the tax on remittance transfers. It increases the tax rate, provides an exception for transfers by U.S. citizens and nationals, and allows a refundable income tax credit for the excise tax paid on remittance transfers. The bill also introduces reporting requirements for remittance transfer providers and includes conforming amendments and penalties. The effective date is tied to a previous law with the tax credit applying to tax years ending after 2025.",
