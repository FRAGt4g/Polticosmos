    "summary": "The 'Buying American Cotton Act of 2025' proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code to establish a domestic cotton consumption credit. This credit aims to incentivize the use of U.S.-grown cotton and products made from it, tracking the cotton's processing through a digital supply chain. The bill defines key terms like 'qualified cotton,' 'eligible article,' and outlines how the credit is calculated based on the cotton's processing location. The bill also includes provisions for an increased credit for qualified cotton yarn and fabric.",
