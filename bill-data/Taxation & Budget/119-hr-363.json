    "summary": "The 'Territorial Economic Recovery Act' (H.R. 363) amends the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax incentive for businesses operating in U.S. territories. The bill creates an exclusion from 'tested income' for 'qualified possession corporations,' which are controlled foreign corporations that derive at least 80% of their gross income from a U.S. possession (like Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) and have at least 75% of that income from active business conducted there. This change effectively lowers the tax burden on these companies, aiming to stimulate economic activity and investment in U.S. territories.",
