It proposes doubling the maximum amount of depreciable business assets that can be immediately expensed, increasing the limit from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. The bill also raises the phase-out threshold for this deduction from $2,500,000 to $3,500,000 of total investment. Additionally, it updates the inflation adjustment base year to 2026. These tax relief measures are intended to apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2025.",
