    "summary": "This bill, titled \"Texas is the New Hollywood Act of 2025,\" aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to incentivize film and television production within the United States, specifically by extending bonus depreciation for qualified productions. It defines \"qualified film or television production\" based on expenditure thresholds in a single state ($100,000 for educational/instructional videos, $500,000 for others) and the exclusion of certain productions. It extends the application deadline to January 1, 2035, and sets the applicable depreciation percentage at 100% for property placed in service between 2026 and 2036. The amendments are effective for property placed in service after December 31, 2025.",
