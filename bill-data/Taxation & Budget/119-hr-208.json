    "summary": "The \"No Budget, No Pay Act\" proposes a measure to hold the salaries of Members of a House of Congress in an escrow account if that chamber fails to agree on a concurrent budget resolution by April 15th. The withheld compensation would be released to the members only after the budget resolution is passed or at the very end of the congressional term, whichever occurs first. This latter provision ensures the law does not violate the 27th Amendment. The act aims to incentivize Congress to meet its budgetary deadlines, applying to fiscal year 2026 and onwards.",
