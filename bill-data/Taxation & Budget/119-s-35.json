    "summary": "This bill, the Homeowners Premium Tax Reduction Act of 2025, proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It introduces an \"above the line\" deduction for homeowners insurance premiums, allowing individuals to deduct a certain amount of qualified premiums (up to $10,000) from their gross income. The bill defines \"qualified insurance premiums\" and \"principal residence,\" and specifies that the deduction will be applied in determining adjusted gross income. The amendments will apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act.",
