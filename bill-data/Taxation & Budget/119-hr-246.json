The bill would raise the current limitation from $10,000 to $15,000 for individuals and to $30,000 for married couples filing a joint return. This change is intended to provide tax relief for individuals, particularly in states with higher property and income taxes. The amendment would apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
