    "summary": "H.R. 2524, the \"REPEAL CBO Requirements Act,\" aims to allow congressional committees to obtain budget estimates from private, reputable accounting firms instead of relying solely on the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). These estimates would be used for budget enforcement purposes, including compliance with various budget acts and rules. The bill mandates that the CBO does not need to produce an estimate if a private firm's estimate is obtained. This change would affect how budget estimates are prepared and used within the legislative process.",
