    "summary": "This bill proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a refundable tax credit for individuals. This credit is for amounts paid for gas and electricity used for primary residences. The credit is capped at $350 per taxable year and is subject to income limitations ($400,000 for joint filers, $200,000 for others). It defines qualified energy costs and principal residence, addresses denial of double benefits and dependents, and includes reporting requirements for landlords. The amendments apply to costs incurred after the bill's enactment.",
