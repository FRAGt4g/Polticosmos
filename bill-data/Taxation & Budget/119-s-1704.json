    "summary": "The National Taxpayer Advocate Enhancement Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify the National Taxpayer Advocate's authority to hire and consult counsel. It aims to align the current operations with the intent of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, as expressed in the conference report. Specifically, the bill allows the Advocate to directly appoint counsel within the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate, affecting how legal resources are managed within the IRS. The amendments are effective as if included in the original 1998 act.",
