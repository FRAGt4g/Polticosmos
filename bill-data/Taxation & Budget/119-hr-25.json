    "summary": "The \"FairTax Act of 2025\" seeks to repeal all federal income taxes, payroll taxes (funding Social Security and Medicare), and estate and gift taxes. It would also abolish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In their place, the bill establishes a single national sales tax, set at 23% for 2027, on the final consumption of goods and services. To offset the burden on necessities, it creates a monthly \"family consumption allowance\" rebate for all legal resident families. The act's provisions are contingent on the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution within seven years.",
