    "summary": "The OPT Fair Tax Act, introduced in the Senate, aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Social Security Act. It seeks to include optional practical training (OPT) for F-1 visa holders as employment for tax purposes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Social Security Act. This will effectively subject OPT participants to these payroll taxes. The amendments would take effect after the bill's enactment.",
