    "summary": "The 'No Tax Subsidies for Stadiums Act of 2025' aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent the use of tax-exempt bonds for financing professional sports stadiums. The bill defines \"professional stadium bond\" and clarifies that bonds used for facilities hosting professional sports exhibitions, games, or training are not eligible for tax-exempt status. This would affect how stadiums are funded and potentially impact the use of public funds for these projects.",
