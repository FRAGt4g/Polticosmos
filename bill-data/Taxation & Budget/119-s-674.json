    "summary": "The Broadband Grant Tax Treatment Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude certain broadband grants from gross income. This means that entities receiving qualified broadband grants, like those from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and other specified programs, will not have to pay federal income tax on those grant funds. The bill also includes provisions to prevent double benefits and clarifies the types of grants covered. The effective date of the act is retroactive to 2021.",
