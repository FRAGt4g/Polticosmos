    "summary": "The \"Implementing Decreases in Overall Government Expenditures Act\" (H.R. 199) establishes an automatic mechanism to cut federal spending. Starting in fiscal year 2026, if total annual appropriations grow by more than 1% compared to the previous year, the bill mandates an across-the-board spending cut. This rescission, equal to the percentage of growth that exceeds 1%, is applied on a pro rata basis to all nonsecurity discretionary appropriations. The bill aims to enforce fiscal discipline by capping the growth of government spending in areas outside of national defense and security.",
