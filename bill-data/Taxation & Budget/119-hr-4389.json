    "summary": "This bill, the Religious Exemptions for Social Security and Healthcare Taxes Act, proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a tax credit or refund for employees who are members of religious faiths that oppose participation in social security and healthcare insurance. These individuals, meeting specific criteria outlined in Section 1402(g)(1), would be eligible for a credit equivalent to the amount of federal insurance taxes deducted from their wages. The changes would apply to taxable years starting after the bill's enactment.",
