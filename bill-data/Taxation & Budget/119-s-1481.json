    "summary": "This bill, the Lifting Our Communities through Advance Liquidity for Infrastructure Act (LOCAL Infrastructure Act), aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It seeks to reinstate advance refunding bonds, effectively reversing a provision of Public Law 115-97 related to tax reform.  The bill was introduced in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Finance. It intends to allow municipalities to refinance existing debt at potentially lower rates. The repeal, if enacted, would take effect immediately.",
