    "summary": "This bill, the \"Protect Innocent Victims of Taxation After Fire Extension Act,\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude qualified wildfire relief payments from gross income. This means individuals receiving compensation for losses, expenses, or damages resulting from qualified wildfire disasters (federally declared disasters after 2014) will not have to pay taxes on that compensation, provided the losses aren't already covered by insurance. The exclusion applies to payments received after December 31, 2025, and ends after December 31, 2032. The bill also includes provisions to prevent double benefits and clarifies the relevant section of the tax code.",
