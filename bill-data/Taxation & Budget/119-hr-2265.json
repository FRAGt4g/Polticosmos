    "summary": "The No Foreign Election Interference Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose penalties on tax-exempt organizations that contribute to political committees if they have received contributions from foreign nationals. It defines \"disqualified political committee contributions\" and sets a penalty equal to twice the contribution amount. The bill also revokes the tax-exempt status of organizations that make more than two such contributions. The amendments apply to contributions made on or after January 1, 2026.",
