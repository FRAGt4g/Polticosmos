    "summary": "The High Rise Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act of 2025 (H.R. 173) proposes a tax incentive to encourage fire safety upgrades in older residential high-rise buildings. It amends the Internal Revenue Code, allowing property owners to depreciate the cost of retrofitting automatic fire sprinkler systems over 15 years, a significant reduction from the current period. This accelerated depreciation allows building owners to deduct expenses more quickly, lowering their tax burden and encouraging the installation of these life-saving systems in residential buildings with floors more than 75 feet above ground level.",
