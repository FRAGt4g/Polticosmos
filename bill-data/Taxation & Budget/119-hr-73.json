    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 73, titled the 'Abortion Is Not Health Care Act of 2025,' proposes an amendment to the U.S. tax code. Introduced by Representative Biggs, it seeks to amend Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The legislation would prohibit individuals from including any costs paid for an abortion when calculating their medical expense deduction for federal income tax purposes. This change would effectively eliminate the tax deductibility of abortion procedures. The amendment would apply to taxable years beginning after the date the bill is enacted into law.",
