    "summary": "The Unauthorized Spending Accountability Act establishes a system to penalize and eventually terminate federal programs operating without a current authorization of appropriations. It creates a three-year cycle starting the fiscal year after a program's authorization expires. In the first year, the relevant budget allocation is cut by 10% of the program's last appropriation. This penalty increases to 15% for the second and third years. If a program remains unauthorized after three years, it is terminated. Programs can avoid these penalties if they are reauthorized by Congress for a period not exceeding three years.",
