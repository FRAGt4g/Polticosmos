    "summary": "This bill, the \"Restore Economic Vitality and Investment in the Virgin Islands Act\" (REVIVE VI Act), amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It aims to exclude certain income derived from services performed in the Virgin Islands when calculating global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). This benefits specific US shareholders, including individuals, trusts, estates, and certain closely held corporations, by exempting qualified Virgin Islands services income from GILTI calculations. The changes apply to foreign corporations' taxable years starting after the Act's enactment.",
