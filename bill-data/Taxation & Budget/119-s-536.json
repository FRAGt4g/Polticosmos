    "summary": "The Fair Sharing of Highways and Roads for Electric Vehicles Act of 2025 proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by imposing a tax on the sale of electric vehicles and their batteries. Specifically, it levies a $550 tax on battery modules weighing over 1,000 pounds and a $1,000 tax on each electric vehicle. Revenue generated from this tax will be transferred to the Highway Trust Fund. The bill defines key terms, including 'electric vehicle' (excluding hybrids) and 'light-duty vehicle.' The amendments would take effect for sales after December 31, 2025.",
