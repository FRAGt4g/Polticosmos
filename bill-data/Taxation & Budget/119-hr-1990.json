    "summary": "This bill, the American Innovation and R&D Competitiveness Act of 2025 (H.R. 1990), amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restore the deduction for research and experimental expenditures. It allows taxpayers to treat these expenditures as expenses rather than chargeable capital, and outlines procedures for adoption and adherence to this method. The bill also includes clerical and conforming amendments related to this deduction, ensuring integration with existing tax provisions and specifies an effective date applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021. This primarily aims to incentivize innovation and research within businesses.",
