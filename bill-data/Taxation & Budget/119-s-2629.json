    "summary": "The Taxpayer Notification and Privacy Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code to require the IRS to provide specific notice to taxpayers when seeking information from third parties. The bill mandates that the notice identifies the specific information sought and gives the taxpayer at least 45 days to respond before the IRS contacts the third party. Exceptions are made if the information is deemed necessary regardless of the taxpayer's ability to provide it. The amendments apply 12 months after the bill's enactment.",
