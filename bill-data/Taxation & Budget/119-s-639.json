    "summary": "The Clergy Act (S. 639) allows members of the clergy (ministers, religious order members, and Christian Science practitioners) to revoke their exemption from Social Security coverage. The revocation application must be filed by a specific deadline, and the revocation's effective date is determined by the applicant. This act also prohibits those who revoke their exemption from re-applying for it, and it includes provisions regarding taxes owed. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in collaboration with the Commissioner of Social Security, is mandated to create a plan to inform eligible clergy about their ability to revoke their exemption.",
