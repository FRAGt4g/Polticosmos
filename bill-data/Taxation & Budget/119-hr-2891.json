    "summary": "This bill, the \"IRA Charitable Rollover Facilitation and Enhancement Act of 2025,\" introduced in the House of Representatives, aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Specifically, it seeks to allow charitable rollovers from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) to donor-advised funds. The bill would repeal a restriction on these rollovers, making it easier for individuals to donate to donor-advised funds through their IRAs and providing potential tax benefits. The amendment would apply to distributions after the enactment date.",
