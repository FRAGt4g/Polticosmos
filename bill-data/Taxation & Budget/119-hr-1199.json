Key provisions include a phased increase in the exclusion percentage based on the holding period (3 years, 4 years, and 5+ years), allowing the exclusion for stock acquired through the conversion of qualified convertible debt instruments, and expanding the applicability of the gain exclusion to stock in all corporations, not just C corporations. The bill also clarifies aggregation rules for S corporations and addresses passive loss treatment and relevant effective dates.",
