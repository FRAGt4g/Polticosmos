    "summary": "The Capital Gains Inflation Relief Act of 2025 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by indexing certain assets to account for inflation when calculating capital gains or losses. This means the basis of certain assets, like common stock and digital assets, would be adjusted upward based on the Gross Domestic Product deflator. This adjustment is designed to reduce the tax burden on gains realized from assets held for more than three years, thus potentially decreasing taxes on investment returns as inflation rises. The Act specifies exceptions, details how the indexing works, and provides rules for pass-through entities and related persons.",
