    "summary": "The 'Safe Water Instruction for Minors Act of 2025' (SWIM Act) amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow qualified water competency and water safety lesson expenses to be treated as medical expenses, thereby potentially reducing tax liability. These expenses include basic water safety and swimming instruction costs, and the purchase of related equipment. There's a $500 annual limit (or $1000 for joint filers/head of household), and the lessons must focus on safety, not competitive training.",
