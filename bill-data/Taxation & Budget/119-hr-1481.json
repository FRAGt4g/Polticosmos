    "summary": "The Catastrophic Risk Transfer Act of 2025 (CART Act) amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a system for taxing catastrophic risk transfer companies. These companies, operating as special purpose insurers, would be taxed to ensure sufficient capital for covering catastrophic insurance losses. The bill defines these companies, outlines tax rules, including dividend taxation, and addresses state taxation of reinsurance premiums, aiming to prevent double taxation. It also includes exemptions from withholding taxes for certain dividends received by non-resident aliens and foreign corporations.",
