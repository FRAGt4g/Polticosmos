    "summary": "The Prevent Family Fire Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to incentivize the sale of secure firearm storage. It establishes a new tax credit for retailers equal to 10% of the sales price of each safe firearm storage device sold, with the credit capped at $400 per device. The bill defines what constitutes an eligible device (e.g., a safe or lock box with an integrated lock) and makes the credit part of the general business credit. This tax incentive is set to apply to sales made through December 31, 2032.",
