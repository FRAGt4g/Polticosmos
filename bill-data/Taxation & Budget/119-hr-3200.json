    "summary": "The Critical Minerals and Manufacturing Support Act (H.R. 3200) amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the advanced manufacturing credit for battery component production. It increases the credit amount for electrode active materials, introduces sourcing requirements for critical minerals and battery components, defines 'foreign entities of concern', expands the definition of electrode active materials (including precursors, binders, and solid-state electrolytes), and specifies certain silicon as an applicable critical material. The amendments apply to components produced and sold after December 31, 2025.",
