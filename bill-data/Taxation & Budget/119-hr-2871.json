    "summary": "The Safeguarding U.S. Supply Chains Act (H.R. 2871) amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restrict the advanced manufacturing production credit. Specifically, it disallows the credit for components produced by, or using technology from, foreign entities of concern, as defined in the William M. Mac Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This primarily affects qualifying battery components. The amendments apply to components produced and sold after the Act's enactment.",
