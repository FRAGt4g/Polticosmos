    "summary": "This bill, titled the \"Native American Health Savings Improvement Act,\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It aims to allow individuals who are eligible for hospital care or medical services through the Indian Health Service (IHS) or a tribal organization to also be eligible to contribute to a Health Savings Account (HSA). Currently, receiving care under another health plan can disqualify an individual from having an HSA. This legislation creates a specific exception, ensuring that receiving IHS assistance does not prevent Native Americans from utilizing these tax-advantaged health accounts. The change would be effective for taxable years after 2024.",
