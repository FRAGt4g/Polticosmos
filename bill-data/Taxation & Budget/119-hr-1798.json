    "summary": "This bill, the End Tobacco Loopholes Act, aims to equalize excise taxes on all tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco. It introduces tax parity, taxing products at similar rates per unit or weight. The bill also imposes taxes on nicotine used in vaping products, establishing regulations and defining \"taxable nicotine.\" Furthermore, it addresses floor stock taxes to account for tax increases, providing a credit. The effective dates for the changes vary depending on the product type, with some provisions taking effect later. The bill also includes provisions for inflation adjustment of tax rates starting in 2026.",
