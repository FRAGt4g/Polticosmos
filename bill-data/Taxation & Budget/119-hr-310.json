    "summary": "Introduced as H.R. 310, the \"Restoring Energy Market Freedom Act\" proposes to amend the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to repeal numerous federal tax credits related to energy. The bill specifically targets credits for renewable electricity production (Sec. 45), carbon oxide sequestration (Sec. 45Q), clean hydrogen production (Sec. 45V), advanced manufacturing (Sec. 45X), clean electricity production and investment (Secs. 45Y, 48), and others. By striking these sections from the tax code, the legislation aims to eliminate these financial incentives, with the changes slated to take effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",
