    "summary": "The \"No Taxation Without Operation Act\" (H.R. 5695) proposes to suspend Federal individual income taxes during any government shutdown. Specifically, it would exempt citizens from federal income taxes on wages, and waive penalties and interest related to income tax payments during the shutdown. It also exempts backpay for furloughed federal employees and contractors. The Treasury Department would be responsible for issuing guidelines for employers to ensure compliance.",
