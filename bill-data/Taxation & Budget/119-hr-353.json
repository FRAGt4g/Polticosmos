    "summary": "The \"Family First Act\" proposes significant changes to the U.S. tax code, effective for years after 2025. It expands the Child Tax Credit to $4,200 for children under 6 and $3,000 for others, making it fully refundable. It introduces a new $2,800 refundable tax credit for pregnant mothers with an \"unborn child\" of at least 20 weeks gestation. The bill also simplifies the Earned Income Tax Credit, eliminates the \"head of household\" filing status and the personal exemption for dependents, removes children from the dependent care credit, and makes the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap permanent.",
