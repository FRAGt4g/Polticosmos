    "summary": "This bill, the \"Reducing Excessive Taxation and Inefficiencies by Reforming Elder Exemptions (RETIREES FIRST) Act,\" aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the income thresholds for including Social Security benefits in taxable income. It adjusts the base amounts for individuals, joint filers, and those married filing separately. The bill also includes provisions for inflation adjustments and ensures that Social Security trust funds are held harmless. Furthermore, it reallocates discretionary appropriations (excluding those related to national security) to offset the cost of tax relief for retirees.",
