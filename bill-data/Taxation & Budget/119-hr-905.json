Key provisions include extending the credit to all taxpayers with dependents (defining 'qualifying dependent' and 'aged dependent'), qualifying students, and individuals with specified dependents. The bill also introduces a monthly payment option for eligible taxpayers receiving large refunds and a special rule for new low-income parents. Additionally, it establishes a volunteer income tax assistance matching grant program to support return preparation programs for low-income taxpayers.",
