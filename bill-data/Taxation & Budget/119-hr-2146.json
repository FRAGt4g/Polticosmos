    "summary": "This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide refunds for taxes previously paid on dyed fuels that are exempt from tax. Specifically, it introduces a new section (6434) allowing individuals who removed eligible, indelibly dyed diesel fuel or kerosene from a terminal and had previously paid tax on it, to receive a refund. The bill specifies the definition of eligible dyed fuel, includes conforming amendments to existing sections of the code, and sets an effective date for the changes.",
