    "summary": "The Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2025 aims to limit a state's ability to tax the income of employees working in multiple states. It generally restricts income tax to the employee's state of residence and any state where the employee works for more than 30 days within a calendar year. The bill clarifies employer responsibilities for withholding and reporting, establishes definitions for key terms like \"employee,\" \"day,\" and \"time and attendance system,\" and outlines a delayed effective date.",
