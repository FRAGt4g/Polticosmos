    "summary": "The Red Tape Reduction Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the exception for de minimis payments by third-party settlement organizations. It reinstates a higher threshold for reporting transactions, requiring reporting only if the amount exceeds $10,000 or the number of transactions exceeds 50. The bill also applies this de minimis rule to backup withholding for third-party network transactions, with an effective date of transactions settled after December 31, 2024.",
