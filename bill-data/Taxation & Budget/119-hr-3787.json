    "summary": "The Emergency Spending Accountability Act mandates that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issue sequestration orders to offset emergency spending. Specifically, it requires outlay savings equal to one-fifth of the total emergency spending to be achieved over five fiscal years. The bill defines emergency spending and outlines exemptions, primarily for Social Security, National Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Medicare. Furthermore, the bill mandates detailed justifications for all instances of emergency spending within legislative measures, and defines relevant terms based on existing budget control acts.",
