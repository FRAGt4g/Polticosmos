    "summary": "H.R. 371, the \"No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act,\" proposes to prohibit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from hiring any new employees. This hiring freeze would remain in effect until the Secretary of the Treasury publicly certifies in writing that no current IRS employee has a \"seriously delinquent tax debt.\" The bill defines this as an outstanding tax debt for which a public notice of lien has been filed. The prohibition includes exceptions for debts being paid under an agreement, debts under appeal, or debts subject to a levy.",
