    "summary": "The Grown in America Act of 2025 proposes a tax credit to incentivize the purchase of American agricultural commodities. This credit is calculated as a percentage of a taxpayer's domestic agricultural input costs, with an overall cap. Eligibility is tied to the proportion of domestically sourced inputs and phases in higher requirements over time. The bill defines key terms like 'agricultural commodity' and 'domestic agricultural input costs,' includes provisions for cooperative organizations, and tasks the Secretary of Agriculture to identify commodities that cannot be produced domestically. The credit is to be incorporated into the general business credit, with specific limitations, and takes effect for taxable years starting after 2025.",
