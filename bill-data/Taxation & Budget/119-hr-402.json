    "summary": "The Debt Explanation Before Taxwriters Act (DEBT Act) requires the Secretary of the Treasury to appear before the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees. This appearance must occur between 21 and 60 days before the national debt is anticipated to reach its legal limit or before \"extraordinary measures\" are taken to prevent default. The Secretary must provide a detailed explanation of these measures, their administrative costs, and how they will be reversed. The bill aims to increase transparency and Congressional oversight of the Treasury's actions when managing the U.S. debt ceiling.",
