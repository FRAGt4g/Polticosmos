    "summary": "This bill, the 'Access to Credit for our Rural Economy Act of 2025' (ACRE Act), amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude from gross income interest received on certain loans secured by rural or agricultural real property by qualified lenders.  The bill defines 'qualified lender' and 'qualified real estate loan'  and includes specific types of real estate like farmland and single-family residences in rural areas. It also requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress within five years analyzing the impact of the exclusion. The amendments apply to taxable years ending after the enactment date.",
