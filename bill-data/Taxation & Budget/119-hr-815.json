    "summary": "This bill, the Brownfields Redevelopment Tax Incentive Reauthorization Act of 2025, aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It seeks to extend the expensing of environmental remediation costs. Specifically, it proposes to allow businesses to deduct the costs of cleaning up contaminated sites (brownfields) for expenses incurred after December 31, 2028, after a gap in coverage. This encourages the redevelopment of these properties by offering a tax break.",
