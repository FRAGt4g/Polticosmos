    "summary": "This bill, the Closing the De Minimis Loophole Act (S. 1867), aims to eliminate the 'de minimis' exception under the Tariff Act of 1930, which allows for duty-free entry of certain low-value goods. It phases out this exception, starting immediately for goods from China, and 120 days after enactment for goods from other countries. The bill also mandates the Treasury Secretary to create new rules for enforcement, data collection, and penalties, and to address international postal shipments regarding this change.",
