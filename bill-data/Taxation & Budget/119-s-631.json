    "summary": "The Rural Historic Tax Credit Improvement Act aims to enhance the rehabilitation credit for buildings in rural areas. It introduces a new credit structure based on whether a project is an affordable housing project or not, allowing for a 40% or 30% credit, respectively. It defines 'applicable rural project' and 'rural area', and includes a $5,000,000 expenditure limitation. The bill allows for the transfer of the credit, establishes tax treatment rules and reporting requirements. It also introduces recapture rules for failing to meet affordable housing requirements. The amendments primarily take effect after December 31, 2025.",
