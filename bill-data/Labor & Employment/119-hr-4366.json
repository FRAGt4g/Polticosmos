    "summary": "The Save Local Business Act aims to clarify the definition of 'joint employer' under the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. It defines joint employment more narrowly, specifying that an employer is only considered a joint employer if they directly and immediately exercise significant control over essential employment terms and conditions, such as hiring, firing, pay, and supervision. The bill seeks to limit the circumstances under which multiple entities can be held jointly liable for labor violations.",
