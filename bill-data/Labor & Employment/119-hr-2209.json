This includes a ban on initiating or implementing any reduction in force and on involuntary separations of employees, except for cause related to misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency. The bill defines relevant terms like 'competitive service' and 'excepted service' and clarifies that the moratorium supplements existing authorities regarding personnel actions.",
