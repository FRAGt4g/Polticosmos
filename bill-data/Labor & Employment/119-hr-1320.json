    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 1320, aims to clarify employee classification under federal law. It stipulates that providing portable benefits to an individual should not be a factor in determining whether that individual is an employee.  A \"portable benefit\" is defined as a work-related benefit (like health insurance, retirement, etc.) that can be maintained regardless of continued work for the original provider. The bill effectively seeks to support independent workers and contractors by clarifying their status in relation to the provision of benefits.",
