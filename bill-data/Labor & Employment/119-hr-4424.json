    "summary": "This bill, the Securing Help for Involuntary Employment Loss and Displacement Act (SHIELD Act), aims to clarify eligibility for unemployment benefits during labor disputes. It amends the Social Security Act to specify when individuals are ineligible for unemployment compensation due to involvement in a strike or other labor dispute (excluding lockouts). It also repeals a provision of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. The amendments take effect two years after enactment, allowing states time to adjust their laws.",
