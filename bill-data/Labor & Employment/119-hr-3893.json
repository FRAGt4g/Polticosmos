    "summary": "The Employment Abundance Act mandates that the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council issue regulations requiring federal contractors to review job classifications. The review aims to identify positions that require a bachelor's degree or higher and assess whether such requirements are demonstrably necessary for essential job functions. Contractors must report their findings, including plans to revise job classifications where degree requirements are deemed unnecessary. Failure to comply may result in ineligibility for future federal contracts. The act does not prevent maintaining educational requirements that are necessary or mandated by law.",
