    "summary": "The Raise the Wage Act of 2025 proposes to increase the federal minimum wage in stages, eventually reaching $17.00 per hour. It also addresses the minimum wage for tipped employees, phasing in increases and ultimately aligning it with the general minimum wage. Further provisions concern the minimum wage for newly hired employees under 20 years old, setting a graduated increase. The bill also amends the Fair Labor Standards Act regarding wages for individuals with disabilities, including a phased increase and a sunset provision for special certificates. Various sections address notification procedures for wage increases and establish a general effective date.",
