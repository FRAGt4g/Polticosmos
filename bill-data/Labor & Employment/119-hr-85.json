    "summary": "The Small Business Flexibility Act (H.R. 85) amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to expand regulations on tip pooling. The bill would allow employers to create tip pools that include both employees who traditionally receive tips, like servers, and employees who do not, such as kitchen staff. This change facilitates a broader distribution of tips among all staff members. This practice would be permissible for pools containing both tipped and non-tipped workers, provided the tipped employees are paid the full federal minimum wage by the employer, not a lower tipped wage.",
