    "summary": "H.R. 240, the 'Protect Local Farms Act,' amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to address overtime for agricultural workers. The bill would establish federal preemption over state-level overtime laws, nullifying any state law that requires overtime pay for farmworkers in a workweek of less than 60 hours. This action would prevent states from enforcing stricter overtime rules (e.g., overtime after a 40-hour week) for agricultural employees, creating a uniform federal standard that supersedes potentially more generous state-level worker protections.",
