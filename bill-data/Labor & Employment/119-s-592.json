    "summary": "The Simplifying Subcontracting Act amends the Small Business Act to require plain writing in solicitations for subcontractors. It mandates that offerors and bidders communicate subcontracting opportunities in easily understood language, as defined by the Plain Writing Act of 2010. Furthermore, the bill stipulates that if a prime contractor fails to comply, they must reissue the solicitation in plain writing within 30 days. The Small Business Administration is directed to create regulations to enforce these requirements.",
