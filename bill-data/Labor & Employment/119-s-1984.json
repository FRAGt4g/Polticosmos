    "summary": "This bill, the Striking and Locked Out Workers Healthcare Protection Act, aims to prevent employers from terminating or altering employee healthcare coverage during lockouts or lawful strikes. It amends the National Labor Relations Act to define these actions as unfair labor practices, thereby imposing civil penalties on employers for violations. The bill also introduces director and officer liability and mandates considerations for penalty determination, including the impact of the actions, employer size, history of violations, and public interest.",
