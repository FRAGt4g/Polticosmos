    "summary": "The Working Families Flexibility Act of 2025 amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to allow private sector employees to receive compensatory time off (comp time) in lieu of monetary overtime pay.  The bill outlines conditions for comp time agreements, including provisions for collective bargaining agreements or individual agreements. It places limits on the amount of comp time that can be accrued, dictates rules for compensation of unused time, and protects employees from coercion regarding its use. It also mandates a GAO report and sets a five-year sunset provision.",
