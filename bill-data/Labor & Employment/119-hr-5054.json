    "summary": "The Freedom From Union Violence Act of 2025 amends the Hobbs Act (18 U.S.C. 1951) to address violence and extortion related to labor disputes. It defines key terms like 'commerce,' 'extortion,' 'labor dispute,' and 'robbery', and outlines exemptions for conduct incidental to peaceful picketing and minor offenses. The bill clarifies that it does not affect existing labor laws and doesn't preclude federal jurisdiction. Effectively, the act aims to increase penalties for union-related violence and extortion impacting interstate commerce.",
