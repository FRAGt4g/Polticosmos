    "summary": "The Food Secure Strikers Act of 2025 aims to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to ensure that workers on strike and their families remain eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The bill seeks to remove current provisions that could make striking workers ineligible for SNAP benefits, replacing them with language that clarifies and protects their access to food assistance during labor disputes. The bill was introduced in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.",
