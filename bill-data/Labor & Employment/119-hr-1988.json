    "summary": "The 'Pay Federal Workers and Servicemembers Act' aims to clarify and expand unemployment compensation eligibility for federal civilian and military personnel who are deemed essential and required to work during a government shutdown but are not being paid. The bill amends Title 5 of the United States Code to treat these employees as separated from service during the shutdown for unemployment compensation purposes, waiving any waiting period. The legislation applies to appropriation lapses starting on or after March 14, 2025.",
