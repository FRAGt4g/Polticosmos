    "summary": "This bill, the Preserving Presidential Management Authority Act, amends Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the United States Code. It grants the President the authority to terminate provisions of collective bargaining agreements entered into under this chapter and clarifies that provisions conflicting with presidential orders are unenforceable. It also mandates that the head of the agency submit a notification to the exclusive representative detailing any such terminations or unenforceable provisions. However, the authority to terminate does not extend to the current President.",
