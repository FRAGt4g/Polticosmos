    "summary": "The Tipped Income Protection and Support Act (TIPS Act) aims to eliminate the separate minimum wage for tipped employees by amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. It mandates that tipped employees receive the standard minimum wage and retain all tips, with exceptions for tip pooling. Additionally, the bill introduces a tax deduction for cash tips, subject to income limitations, and mandates adjustments to tax withholding to account for this deduction. The amendments are slated to take effect for taxable years starting after December 31, 2025.",
