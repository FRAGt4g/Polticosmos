    "summary": "The TSA Commuting Fairness Act aims to reduce commuting burdens for Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees by directing the Administrator of the TSA to conduct a feasibility study. The study, to be completed within 270 days of enactment, will examine the possibility of considering travel time between duty locations and transit points (parking, bus stops) as on-duty hours. It mandates the study to analyze commute times, potential benefits, cost considerations, and reporting methods, specifically considering small, medium, and large hub airports.",
