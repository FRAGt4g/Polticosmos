    "summary": "The 'Protecting Jobs in American Ports Act' aims to modify coastwise endorsement rules for passenger vessels. It allows certain passenger vessels, even if not built in the US, to transport passengers between US ports (directly or via a foreign port). It amends existing laws (Title 46, United States Code) regarding coastwise laws and repeals a related section. The bill explicitly states that it does not exempt vessels from other applicable US laws except as specifically mentioned.",
