    "summary": "The Modern Worker Empowerment Act, introduced in the Senate, aims to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The bill's primary objective is to redefine the term \"employee\" within the Act to align with the principles of common law. This involves modifying the existing definition to incorporate the established legal framework for determining employee status. The bill seeks to clarify and potentially alter the criteria used to classify workers for the purposes of labor regulations.",
