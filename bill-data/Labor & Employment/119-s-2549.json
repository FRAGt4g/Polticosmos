    "summary": "The Time Off to Vote Act mandates that employers provide employees with a minimum of two consecutive hours of paid leave to vote in Federal elections. This leave can be used for voting, returning a mail-in ballot, or other voting-related activities. Employers can designate the hours for leave, including during early voting, but cannot include lunch breaks. The act prohibits employer interference, retaliation, and discrimination against employees exercising their voting rights. The Secretary of Labor has investigative and enforcement authority, including civil penalties for violations.",
