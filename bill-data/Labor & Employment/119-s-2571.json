    "summary": "The Farmworker Smoke and Excessive Heat Protection Act of 2025 aims to protect agricultural workers from the health hazards of wildfire smoke and extreme heat. The bill mandates the Secretary of Labor to establish an occupational safety and health standard. Initially, it requires employers to provide protective equipment (N95 respirators, water, cooling facilities), training, and rest breaks when air quality or heat levels reach dangerous thresholds. The Secretary must then promulgate a permanent standard within 90 days, providing at least the same level of protection and detailing health impacts. Collaboration with community organizations is also encouraged.",
