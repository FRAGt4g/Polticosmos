    "summary": "The Delphi Retirees Pension Restoration Act aims to increase benefits for eligible participants and beneficiaries of specified Delphi pension plans. It mandates recalculation of benefits to reflect the full vested plan benefit, resulting in potential lump-sum payments to make up for underpayments. The bill addresses funding for increased benefits from the PBGC fund, allows the PBGC to issue regulations, and details the tax treatment of lump-sum payments, particularly in the event of a participant's death. It amends ERISA to include this benefit restoration in the basic benefits guarantee.",
