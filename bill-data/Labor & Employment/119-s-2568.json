    "summary": "The Protecting American Jobs Act amends the National Labor Relations Act, significantly curtailing the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) authority. It limits the NLRB's rulemaking power to internal functions, restricts its ability to issue complaints and prosecute unfair labor practices, and shifts enforcement mechanisms, largely replacing NLRB actions with civil lawsuits. The bill also contains conforming amendments and mandates the review and revision/rescission of existing regulations to align with these changes.",
