    "summary": "The 'More Paid Leave for More Americans Act' establishes a grant program managed by the Secretary of Labor to incentivize states to create paid family leave programs. It mandates minimum requirements for these programs, including benefit amounts, eligibility, and the establishment of 'covered partnerships.' The bill also creates an Interstate Paid Leave Action Network (I-PLAN) to facilitate interstate agreements, streamlined benefit delivery and reduce administrative burden. Grants are authorized for a national intermediary to support the I-PLAN and for states adopting paid leave programs.",
