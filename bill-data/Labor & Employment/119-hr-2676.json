    "summary": "The bill, titled the \"No Union Time on the Taxpayer\u2019s Dime Act\", aims to eliminate the use of \"official time\" for federal employees who are engaged in union business. This means that employees would need to conduct union activities outside of their regular work hours and at their own expense rather than using taxpayer-funded time. The bill amends title 5 of the United States Code concerning federal employee labor relations.",
