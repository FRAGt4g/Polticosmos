    "summary": "This bill, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act, aims to establish and protect collective bargaining rights for public safety officers (law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel) employed by state and local governments. It mandates the Federal Labor Relations Authority to determine if states provide substantially equivalent rights and responsibilities. If not, the Authority will create regulations. The bill outlines specific rights, including the right to form and join unions, bargain over wages and working conditions, and utilize binding arbitration. It emphasizes federal encouragement of labor-management cooperation and non-interference with existing state laws that provide similar or greater protections.",
