    "summary": "The Workforce Mobility Act of 2025 aims to prohibit most noncompete agreements, allowing workers greater freedom to change jobs. The bill makes exceptions for sales of businesses or partnership dissolutions, and protects trade secrets. It mandates notice of the Act's provisions, authorizes the FTC and Department of Labor to enforce the law, and allows for private rights of action. It also forbids predispute arbitration agreements and joint-action waivers regarding noncompete violations.",
