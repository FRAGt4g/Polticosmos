    "summary": "The Back to Work Act (H.R. 357) amends U.S. law to significantly limit telework for federal employees. It generally restricts teleworking to no more than 40% of workdays per pay period. The bill requires annual agency head approval for telework agreements and mandates monitoring of remote employees. While agency heads can grant waivers for specific cases, such as for military spouses or hard-to-fill positions, it also adjusts locality pay for teleworkers to the 'Rest of United States' rate. Additionally, it mandates annual agency reports to Congress on telework productivity, costs, and security, with oversight from the GAO.",
