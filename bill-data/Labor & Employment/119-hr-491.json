    "summary": "This bill, titled the \"Equal COLA Act\", aims to amend U.S. law to achieve parity in cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) between two federal retirement systems. It would change the formula for the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) to match that of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Specifically, it mandates that the annual COLA for FERS annuities be the full percentage change in the consumer price index, eliminating a provision that often resulted in a lower adjustment for FERS retirees. This change would apply to all future COLAs for all FERS annuitants.",
