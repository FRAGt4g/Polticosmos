    "summary": "The \"Federal Employee Return to Work Act\" (H.R. 236) proposes financial disincentives for federal employees who telework at least one day per week. Under the bill, these employees would be ineligible for annual pay adjustments and their locality pay would be reset to the lowest \"Rest of U.S.\" rate, regardless of their actual, higher-cost location. The legislation provides exceptions for certain groups, including disabled employees with reasonable accommodations, Foreign Service members, federal law enforcement officers, and active-duty military personnel. The bill aims to encourage a return to in-person work for the federal workforce.",
