    "summary": "The Public Safety Free Speech Act aims to protect the free speech rights of public safety officers (law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency medical services personnel). It allows these employees to sue their employers for adverse employment actions taken due to expressing personal opinions on matters like public safety services, working conditions, employer policies, and political/religious opinions. The bill outlines exceptions, such as when speech encourages violence, discloses confidential information, or promotes withholding essential services. It specifies potential remedies for successful plaintiffs, and clarifies the bill's relationship with existing laws.",
