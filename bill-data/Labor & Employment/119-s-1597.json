    "summary": "The Paycheck Protection Act aims to prevent federal agencies and the Postal Service from deducting labor organization dues, fees, or political contributions from employee pay. The bill amends existing sections of the United States Code (Title 5 and Title 39) to explicitly prohibit these deductions. This legislation seeks to affect how federal and postal employees are compensated and impacts the financial operations of labor organizations representing these employees.",
