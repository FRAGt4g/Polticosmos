    "summary": "The SAFE HIRE Act (S. 2359) amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require covered employers (issuers of securities) to include a certification of employment eligibility compliance in their annual reports. This certification, signed by the principal executive officer and principal human resources officer, attests to compliance with employment eligibility verification requirements (including Form I-9 and E-Verify) and the disclosure of any significant deficiencies or violations of immigration law. Criminal penalties are established for false certification or failure to certify. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, will issue rules for implementation.",
