    "summary": "The Improve Employer-Directed Skills Act amends the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. It defines \"employer-directed skills development\" and provides an exception to interview requirements for individuals referred by employers for on-the-job training. It also allows employers to contract with local boards to provide skills development programs if they meet specific criteria, including program length, credentials, costs, and a commitment to employ participants. The bill replaces references to \"customized training\" with \"employer-directed skills development.\"",
