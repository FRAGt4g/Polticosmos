    "summary": "The \"Federal Employee Performance and Accountability Act of 2025\" introduces a 5-year pilot program to create a performance-based pay structure for certain federal employees (GS-11 and above). Participating agencies would enroll 1-10% of eligible staff. Based on annual reviews, employees exceeding expectations can receive up to a 10% pay raise and bonuses, while those underperforming face a 10% pay cut and mandatory training. The program aims to increase productivity, accountability, and efficiency in public service, with oversight from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and reporting requirements to Congress.",
