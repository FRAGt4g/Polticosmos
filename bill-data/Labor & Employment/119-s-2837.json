    "summary": "The Protect America's Workforce Act (S. 2837) aims to nullify two Executive Orders (14251 and 14343) that relate to exclusions from Federal labor-management relations programs. The bill dictates that the Executive Orders will have no effect, and no federal funds can be allocated for their enforcement. Furthermore, the legislation ensures that existing collective bargaining agreements between federal agencies and labor organizations will remain in effect until the end of their terms.",
