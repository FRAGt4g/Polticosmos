    "summary": "The \"Federal Employee Student Debt Transparency Act\" (H.R. 66) would require high-level executive branch employees\u2014specifically, Senior Executive Service (SES) and Schedule C political appointees\u2014to disclose their federal student loan debt. These officials must file annual reports detailing their outstanding loan balances. The Office of Government Ethics would then report the aggregate debt total to Congress and publicly identify any employee who fails to report. The bill aims to increase transparency regarding the financial interests and potential conflicts of senior government officials.",
