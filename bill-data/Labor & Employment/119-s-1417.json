    "summary": "This bill, the Michael Enzi Voluntary Protection Program Act, authorizes the Department of Labor to establish and maintain a voluntary protection program for employers. This program encourages companies to establish comprehensive safety and health management systems, offering exemptions from programmed inspections for participating worksites. The bill outlines program requirements, including applications, self-evaluations, on-site evaluations, and oversight, while also mandating the modernization of the program's administrative technology. It also includes provision for a tiered, no-cost safety challenge program, requires the DOL to ensure a smooth transition from existing programs, and specifies funding allocation for the program's execution.",
