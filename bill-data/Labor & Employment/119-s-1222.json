    "summary": "The Financial Freedom Act of 2025 (S. 1222) aims to prevent the Secretary of Labor from limiting investment options within individual retirement accounts (IRAs) controlled by participants and beneficiaries. The bill amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to clarify fiduciary duties regarding investment choices, particularly concerning self-directed brokerage windows within pension plans. It ensures fiduciaries aren't required to endorse specific investments beyond risk-return characteristics and prohibits the Secretary of Labor from restricting investment types offered through self-directed brokerage windows.",
