    "summary": "This bill, HR 1319, aims to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the National Labor Relations Act. It clarifies the criteria for determining whether an individual is classified as an employee or an independent contractor. The bill emphasizes that significant control over work details by the employer is a key factor in employee classification, and it outlines factors that should not be used in determining employee status, such as requiring compliance with legal or health and safety standards. The bill also applies the amended employee definition from the Fair Labor Standards Act to the National Labor Relations Act.",
