    "summary": "The \"Reliability for Ratepayers Act\" amends the Bonneville Project Act of 1937 to grant the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) greater flexibility in setting employee compensation. The bill directs the BPA to create a new compensation plan, separate from standard federal pay scales, to address hiring and retention difficulties. This plan will be based on annual surveys of similar jobs in the public electric utility sector in the Western US. The objective is to make BPA's pay competitive enough to attract and retain a skilled workforce, thereby ensuring operational reliability for its customers (ratepayers).",
