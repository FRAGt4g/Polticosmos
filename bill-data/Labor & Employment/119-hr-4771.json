    "summary": "The Transformation to Competitive Integrated Employment Act (HR 4771) aims to help employers transition from using special certificates under Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which allow subminimum wage payments for individuals with disabilities, to models that support competitive integrated employment. The bill authorizes grants for states and certificate holders to facilitate this transition, phases out special certificates, and offers technical assistance. It also mandates reporting on wages and employment outcomes.",
