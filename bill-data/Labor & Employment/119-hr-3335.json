    "summary": "The bill, titled the \"Children Don't Belong on Tobacco Farms Act,\" aims to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. It seeks to prohibit the employment of children under 18 in tobacco-related agriculture, specifically those with direct contact with tobacco plants or dried leaves. This is achieved by deeming such employment as oppressive child labor within the existing labor laws. The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Ms. DeLauro and several co-sponsors and referred to the Committee on Education and Workforce.",
