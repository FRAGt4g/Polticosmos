    "summary": "The Farmworker Smoke and Excessive Heat Protection Act of 2025 aims to establish an occupational safety and health standard to protect farmworkers from wildfire smoke and extreme heat. The bill mandates agricultural operation employers provide protective equipment (N95 respirators, water, cooling facilities) and training on their use. It also requires mandatory rest breaks.  The Secretary of Labor is directed to create an initial standard and then a permanent standard within 90 days of enactment. The Secretary is also charged with offering technical assistance and developing training materials, collaborating with relevant organizations to reach farmworkers.",
