It mandates recalculation of benefits for eligible participants and beneficiaries under covered plans, ensuring they receive their full vested plan benefits. The bill also provides for lump-sum payments to make up for past underpayments. It establishes a trust fund to finance the increased benefits. Finally, it outlines regulations and tax treatment related to the payments.",
