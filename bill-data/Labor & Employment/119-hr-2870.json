    "summary": "The Working Families Flexibility Act of 2025 amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to allow private sector employees to receive compensatory time off (comp time) in lieu of monetary overtime pay. The bill outlines conditions for comp time, including agreements between employers and employees, accrual limits, compensation rates for unused time, and employee protections. It also mandates a GAO report and sets a sunset clause for the Act. The bill explicitly prohibits employers from coercing employees regarding comp time and provides remedies for violations.",
