    "summary": "The LIFT Act aims to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Key provisions include gradually increasing the federal minimum wage to $17.00 per hour, indexing future increases to median wage growth. It also addresses subminimum wages for youth, student-learners, and those with disabilities, increasing those rates as well. The bill modifies regulations for tipped employees, increases civil penalties for violations, and authorizes grants to states to enforce wage laws. Additionally, it establishes a National Advisory Committee on the Hospitality Industry and restores and makes permanent COVID-era EITC improvements.",
