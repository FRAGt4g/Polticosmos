    "summary": "The Tipped Employee Protection Act, introduced in the House of Representatives, aims to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The bill revises the definition of a \"tipped employee\" by changing how tips and wages are calculated to determine eligibility. It removes the requirement that the employee's occupation is considered and specifies different time periods an employer can use to determine if the combined pay is equal to or greater than the effective minimum wage.",
