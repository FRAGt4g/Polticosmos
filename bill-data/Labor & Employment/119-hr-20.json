    "summary": "The 'Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2025' seeks to strengthen workers' rights to unionize. It amends U.S. labor law by expanding the definitions of 'employee' and 'joint employer,' increasing penalties for employer misconduct, and overriding state 'right-to-work' laws by permitting 'fair share' fee agreements. The bill also streamlines union elections with provisions for electronic voting, prohibits employers from permanently replacing striking workers, and creates a private right of civil action for employees whose organizing rights are violated.",
