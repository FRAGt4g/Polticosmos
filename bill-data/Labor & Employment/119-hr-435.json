    "summary": "This bill, the 'Direct Hire To Fight Fires' Act, aims to expedite the hiring of Federal wildland firefighters and support personnel. It grants direct hire authority to the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior, allowing them to bypass certain civil service hiring regulations to fill critical positions. The legislation also mandates the development of policies to streamline recruitment, reduce redundancies, and ease inter-agency transfers. Finally, it requires annual public reports to Congress detailing hiring needs, current staffing, vacancies, and other recommendations for improvement.",
