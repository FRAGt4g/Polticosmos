    "summary": "The Retire through Ownership Act (S. 2403) amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to clarify the definition of \"adequate consideration\" for closely held stock within employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs). It allows fiduciaries of ESOPs to rely on the principles of IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60 when determining fair market value, effectively providing more guidance on how to value assets in these plans. The amendments apply to determinations made on or after the bill's enactment date.",
