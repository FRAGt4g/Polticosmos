    "summary": "The 'Saving DOE's Workforce Act' aims to prevent layoffs at the Department of Energy (DOE). It imposes a moratorium on the DOE initiating or implementing any reduction in force, and on any involuntary separations of employees (except for cause related to misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency). This moratorium is in effect until full-year appropriations for the DOE for fiscal year 2026 are enacted. The bill references definitions from U.S. Code Title 5 regarding employee classifications.",
