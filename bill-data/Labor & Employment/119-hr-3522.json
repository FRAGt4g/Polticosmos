    "summary": "This bill, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act of 2025, amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and other laws to clarify standards for federal employment discrimination and retaliation claims. It specifies how unlawful practices are established, particularly relating to age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, and disability in employment. The bill also defines \"demonstrates\" and outlines remedies for violations, including declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney's fees, but generally prohibits damages or orders for reinstatement/promotion if the employer can prove they would have taken the same action regardless of the discriminatory factor. The bill covers federal employees and states these amendments apply to pending claims.",
