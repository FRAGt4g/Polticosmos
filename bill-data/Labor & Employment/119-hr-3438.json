    "summary": "The Fair Wage Act of 2025 amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to establish a cost-of-living based federal minimum wage. It mandates a regional minimum wage tied to the national average hourly wage, adjusted by a regional price parity. The bill also adjusts the minimum cash wage for tipped employees to 30% of the regional minimum wage. Additionally, it modifies the minimum wage for newly hired employees aged 18 or younger to 2/3 of the area's minimum wage and revises age-related provisions.",
