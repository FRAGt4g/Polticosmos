    "summary": "The Employee Ownership Fairness Act of 2025 aims to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to allow employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) participants to fully utilize their defined contribution plans, even if their ESOP benefits increase. It addresses limitations imposed by sections 404 and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, which can hinder diversification of retirement savings for ESOP participants. The bill proposes excluding employer stock contributions and loan repayment contributions from contribution calculations and applies separate limitations for ESOPs.",
