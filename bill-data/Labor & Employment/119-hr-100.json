    "summary": "H.R. 100, the \"Protect the Gig Economy Act of 2025,\" aims to shield gig economy companies and small businesses from class action lawsuits. The bill proposes an amendment to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which governs class actions. This change would specifically prohibit courts from certifying any class action lawsuit where the central claim alleges that workers were misclassified as independent contractors instead of employees. This would require workers who believe they are misclassified to file individual legal claims rather than suing collectively as a group.",
