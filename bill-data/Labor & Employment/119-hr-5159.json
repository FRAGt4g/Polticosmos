    "summary": "This bill, the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act (H.R. 5159), aims to repeal the provision of the National Labor Relations Act that allows states to enact \"right-to-work\" laws. These laws currently prohibit agreements that require union membership as a condition of employment. The bill intends to protect and expand labor rights by pre-empting state laws that weaken unions' ability to organize and bargain collectively.",
