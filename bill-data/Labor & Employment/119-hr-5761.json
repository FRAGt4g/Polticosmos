    "summary": "The Fair Warning Act of 2025 amends the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act to strengthen protections for workers facing job losses due to site closings and mass layoffs. It expands the definition of 'employer', clarifies notice requirements, increases the notification period to 90 days, enhances penalties for violations, mandates a public database of layoff notices, and prohibits waivers of worker rights. The bill also specifies exceptions to the notification requirements in certain unforeseen circumstances and requires employers to provide information on available benefits and services.",
