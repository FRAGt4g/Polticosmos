    "summary": "The American Franchise Act aims to clarify the definition of \"joint employer\" in relation to franchisors and franchisees. It amends the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act to specify when a franchisor can be considered a joint employer of a franchisee's employees. The bill defines \"direct and immediate control\" over essential terms of employment (wages, benefits, hours, hiring, discharge, discipline, supervision, and direction) to limit franchisor liability and preserve the franchise business model. The bill also includes definitions for key terms like 'franchise', 'franchisee', and 'franchiser'.",
