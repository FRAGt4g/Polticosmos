    "summary": "The Retire through Ownership Act (H.R. 5169) amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  It focuses on the definition of \"adequate consideration\" for closely held stock within employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs). The bill allows ESOP fiduciaries to rely on valuations from independent appraisers, provided the appraiser follows the principles of IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60. The changes become effective upon the bill's enactment.",
