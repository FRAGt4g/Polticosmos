    "summary": "This bill, the Empowering Employer Child and Elder Care Solutions Act, amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exclude payments or reimbursements for child or dependent care services from the rate used to compute overtime compensation. This means that employer-provided child or dependent care benefits would not be factored into an employee's overtime pay calculation.",
