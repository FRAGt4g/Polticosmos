    "summary": "The Financial Freedom Act of 2025 aims to prevent the Secretary of Labor from restricting the investment options available to participants and beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts (IRAs) who control their account assets. It amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to clarify fiduciary duties regarding investment choices, particularly concerning self-directed brokerage windows within pension plans. The bill ensures fiduciaries aren't required to favor or disfavor specific investments (other than by risk-return) and prevents the Secretary from regulating investment choices within self-directed brokerage windows.",
