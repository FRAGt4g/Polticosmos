    "summary": "This bill, the Employee Benefit Security Administration Investigations Transparency Act, mandates the Employee Benefit Security Administration (EBSA) to submit an annual report to Congress detailing the status of its investigations. The report must include information such as the opening date, office, and document request dates for each investigation but excludes the identification of private parties involved. It also clarifies when an investigation is considered concluded. The goal is to increase transparency regarding EBSA investigations to Congress and the public.",
