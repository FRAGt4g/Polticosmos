    "summary": "The Telework Reform Act of 2025 amends Title 5 of the United States Code to address telework for federal employees. It redefines terms such as 'agency-designated worksite,' 'approved alternative worksite,' 'remote work,' and 'telework.' The bill outlines telework requirements, limitations on remote work, training and monitoring provisions, and policy and support mechanisms for telework programs. It also mandates reports from various agencies, OPM regulations, and allows noncompetitive appointment for veterans and spouses in remote work positions. Additionally includes a pilot program for spouses of law enforcement officers.",
