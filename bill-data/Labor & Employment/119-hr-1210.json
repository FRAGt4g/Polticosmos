    "summary": "The bill, titled the Protecting Taxpayers\u2019 Wallets Act of 2025, mandates that federal agencies charge labor organizations for the use of agency resources, including employee time and other resources. Fees will be calculated based on factors like union representative time and provided resources. Failure to pay fees can lead to penalties, including a denial of union time, termination of allotments, and ultimately, decertification of the labor organization. The bill also specifies time-tracking requirements and details on fee determinations, enforcement, and definitions.",
