    "summary": "The Federal Employee Performance and Accountability Act of 2025 establishes a 5-year pilot program for a performance-based pay structure for certain federal employees. The program focuses on enhancing productivity, accountability, and employee satisfaction. Participating agencies will set performance metrics for employees, and evaluations will lead to tiered salary adjustments (increases up to 15% for exceeding expectations, no change for meeting expectations, and a 15% reduction and training for not meeting expectations), discretionary bonuses, and non-monetary benefits. The bill mandates annual reports on program outcomes and assessments by the Office of Management and Budget and the Comptroller General.",
