    "summary": "The Citizen Legislature Anti-Corruption Reform of Public Service Act (CLEAN Public Service Act) seeks to terminate traditional pension plans for Members of Congress. This bill amends U.S. law to end future participation and contributions for Members in both the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), effective 90 days after enactment. Rights and benefits accrued prior to this date are protected. The bill does not affect Members' eligibility to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and explicitly excludes the Vice President from its provisions.",
