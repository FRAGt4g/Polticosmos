    "summary": "The Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 1115) aims to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to strengthen protections against wage discrimination based on sex. The bill seeks to enhance enforcement of equal pay requirements, provide training and research on pay disparities, and prohibit employers from relying on prospective employees' wage history. It also establishes a national award for pay equity, requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect pay data, and outlines penalties for violations. The Act takes effect six months after enactment.",
