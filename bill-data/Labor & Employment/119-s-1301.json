    "summary": "The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2025 aims to clarify the rights of Indian Tribes under the National Labor Relations Act. The bill amends the Act to specifically define \"employer\" to include Indian Tribes and their enterprises on their lands. It also defines \"Indian Tribe,\" \"Indian,\" and \"Indian lands.\" The core goal is to establish greater self-determination for tribes in labor matters within their territories.",
