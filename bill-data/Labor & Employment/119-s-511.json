    "summary": "The \"Protecting Taxpayers\u2019 Wallets Act of 2025\" amends Title 5 of the United States Code to require federal agencies to charge labor organizations for the use of agency resources, including office space, equipment, and employee time (union time). Agencies will calculate fees based on union time and provided resources, with payments going to the Treasury. The bill also details penalties for non-payment, including denial of union time and potential decertification of the labor organization, and mandates agency Inspector General evaluations of compliance. Additionally, it addresses time-tracking of union labor representatives.",
