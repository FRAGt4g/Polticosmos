    "summary": "The Save Our Staff Act of 2025 aims to protect employees of specific Small Business Administration (SBA) offices from layoffs. It defines \"covered offices\" as those providing counseling, training, disaster relief, or contracting certifications. The bill prohibits covered offices from undertaking reductions in force after the date of enactment and mandates the re-employment of SBA employees laid off since January 20, 2025, with back pay and the same positions and pay rates. This legislation intends to safeguard SBA personnel and support small business initiatives.",
