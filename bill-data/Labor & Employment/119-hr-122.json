    "summary": "The \"Original Living American Wage Act\" proposes to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act by significantly increasing the federal minimum wage. It schedules a series of annual raises, starting at $10.59 an hour in 2026 and reaching $26.59 an hour by 2030. Beginning in 2031, the wage will be recalculated every seven years. The new rate will be set to ensure a full-time worker earns an income 40% higher than the supplemental poverty threshold for a renting family of four, aiming to provide a living wage that addresses poverty and housing affordability.",
