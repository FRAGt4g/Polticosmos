    "summary": "This bill, titled the \"MANAGER Act,\" requires federal agencies to conduct annual surveys of their managers. The surveys are designed to gauge managers' attitudes and confidence regarding the employee discipline system, the support they receive, their training, and the impact of underperforming employees on workplace morale. The bill amends an existing law to mandate specific questions for these surveys, including options for narrative responses. It also requires the Office of Personnel Management to update its regulations within 180 days to implement these new survey requirements across government.",
