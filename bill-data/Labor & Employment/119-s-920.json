    "summary": "This bill, the Preventing Child Labor Exploitation in Federal Contracting Act, aims to ensure federal contractors comply with child labor laws. It mandates that entities seeking federal contracts annually declare their compliance, and it prohibits contracts with violators. It requires the Secretary of Labor to create a list of non-compliant entities, and to conduct suspension and debarment proceedings. The bill also increases penalties for child labor violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act, mandates training programs on the topic, and orders a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on the prevalence of such violations among federal contractors. It explicitly states that no additional funds are authorized.",
