It defines minimum salary and wage requirements, indexed to inflation, for full-time and part-time staff, respectively. The bill authorizes significant appropriations to the Department of Education, which will then award grants to states. States must submit applications outlining timelines, goals for wage increases, and formulas for distributing funds to local educational agencies, emphasizing support for those serving low-income students. The act includes provisions for technical assistance, monitoring, and rules regarding collective bargaining and supplementing salaries.",
