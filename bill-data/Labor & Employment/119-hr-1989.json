    "summary": "The Protect Our Probationary Employees Act allows federal employees terminated during a probationary period to potentially resume that period upon reinstatement. The bill applies to involuntary separations occurring between January 20, 2025, and January 20, 2029. It defines terms like 'covered appointment' and 'covered probationary employee' to clarify its scope. The overall goal is to provide a mechanism for those unfairly dismissed to complete their probationary period.",
