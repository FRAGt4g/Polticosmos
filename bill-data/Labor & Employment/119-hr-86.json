    "summary": "Introduced by Rep. Biggs of Arizona, H.R. 86, cited as the \"Nullify Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act\" or \"NOSHA Act,\" proposes the complete elimination of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The bill seeks to achieve this by repealing the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the landmark legislation that created the agency. If passed, this act would abolish the federal body responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety and health standards across the United States. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Education and Workforce.",
