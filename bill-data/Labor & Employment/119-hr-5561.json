    "summary": "The Picket Line Protection Act of 2025 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude strike benefits from gross income. Introduced by Mr. Thanedar, the bill specifically targets compensation provided to labor organization members as a replacement for lost wages due to a strike. The amendments would apply retroactively to compensation received after January 1, 2025. The bill's intention is to provide economic relief to striking workers by reducing their tax burden on strike benefits.",
