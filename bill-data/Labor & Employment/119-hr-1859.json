    "summary": "The Apprenticeship Opportunity Act aims to support individuals in apprenticeships. It mandates states to disregard income earned during the first year of an apprenticeship when determining eligibility for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits. Failure to comply results in a reduction of the state's TANF grant. The bill is designed to encourage participation in apprenticeships by easing financial burdens on participants.",
