    "summary": "The 'Ensuring Workers Get PAID Act of 2025' establishes a Payroll Audit Independent Determination (PAID) program within the Department of Labor. This voluntary program allows employers to self-audit for wage and hour violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act. If violations are found and remedied, the Administrator will oversee settlements with affected employees. The bill aims to encourage employers to correct wage errors, provides resources, and offers a degree of confidentiality to participating employers. It also amends the Fair Labor Standards Act regarding retaliation.",
