    "summary": "The 'Stopping to Efficiently Review Varying Impacts of Cuts to Employment Act' (SERVICE Act) aims to limit workforce reductions at federal agencies. It mandates that agencies cannot reduce their workforce by more than 5% until they submit a report to the Comptroller General and Congress analyzing the expected financial and mission-related impacts of the reduction. The Comptroller General will then review the agency's report and submit their findings to relevant congressional committees within 180 days.",
