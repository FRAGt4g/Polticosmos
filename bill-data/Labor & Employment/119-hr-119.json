    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 119, prohibits any entity that has received federal funds from specified COVID-19 relief packages (including the CARES Act and American Rescue Plan Act) from requiring its employees to get a COVID-19 vaccine. If an entity that received these funds imposes such a mandate, it would be required to return the money to the Federal Government. The bill essentially ties the receipt of federal pandemic aid to a ban on employer vaccine mandates, aiming to protect employees from being required to be vaccinated as a condition of employment.",
