    "summary": "The Susan Muffley Act of 2025 aims to increase pension benefits for participants and beneficiaries of specific terminated pension plans, primarily those related to Delphi Corporation. It mandates the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to recalculate benefits to provide full vested plan benefits, considering the original plan's termination date.  The bill also establishes a trust fund in the Treasury to cover the increased benefit costs and related administrative expenses. Eligible participants will receive lump-sum payments to cover underpaid benefits, with added interest.  The bill specifies covered plans and outlines administrative review processes.",
