    "summary": "The \"Restoring Biological Truth to the Workplace Act\" amends Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on their expression concerning the \"binary or biological nature of sex,\" including expression inside or outside the workplace, and the use of pronouns. The bill also prohibits discrimination based on an employee's use of single-sex areas like bathrooms and changing rooms and eliminates common legal defenses for such actions.",
