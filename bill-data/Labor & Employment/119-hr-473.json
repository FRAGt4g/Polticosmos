    "summary": "The \"Stopping Home Office Work\u2019s Unproductive Problems Act of 2025\" (SHOW UP Act) mandates federal agencies to revert their telework policies to the levels in effect on December 31, 2019, within 30 days of enactment. It prohibits expanding telework until specific conditions are met. Agencies must conduct and submit a study to Congress on the operational, financial, and security impacts of expanded telework during the COVID-19 pandemic. To increase telework beyond pre-pandemic levels, agencies must submit a new plan certified by the Office of Personnel Management, proving it will positively impact the agency's mission and be cost-effective.",
