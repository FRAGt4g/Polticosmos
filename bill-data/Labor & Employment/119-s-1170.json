    "summary": "The Taxpayer-Funded Union Time Transparency Act mandates that federal agencies submit annual reports to Congress detailing the costs and specifics of official time used by employees for union activities. This includes the cost of official time, employee salaries, benefits, and hours spent on union-related work. Agencies must also report on costs associated with collective bargaining, including travel, expert fees, and property usage by labor organizations. The bill also requires GAO audits of agency accounting practices related to these expenditures.",
