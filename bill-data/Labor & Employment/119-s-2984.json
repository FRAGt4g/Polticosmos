    "summary": "This bill, the Employee Rights Act, aims to reform US labor laws. Key provisions include amending the National Labor Relations Act to: specify voting eligibility for union elections (excluding those without lawful immigration status), enhance employee privacy regarding personal information, and define independent contractor status more narrowly. It also addresses union dues, joint employer status, and tribal sovereignty. Additionally, the bill seeks to amend federal law to more strongly penalize violence and threats related to labor disputes, and to restrict DEI initiatives in collective bargaining agreements.",
