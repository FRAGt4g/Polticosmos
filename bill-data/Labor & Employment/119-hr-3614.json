    "summary": "The Fairness, Inclusion, Rehabilitation, and Expungement for Incarcerated Firefighters Act (FIRE Act) aims to improve conditions for incarcerated firefighters. It mandates coverage under the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act, including defining 'incarcerated firefighter' and 'correctional facility.' The bill provides incentives for states to adopt similar protections and offers grants for both safety measures and reentry programs. Crucially, it establishes a process for expunging the records of eligible incarcerated firefighters after fulfilling specific sentence requirements, including conditions of supervised release, and outlines how expungement affects future legal proceedings and record disclosure. It also establishes a reentry program that provides job training, placement services, and mentoring to individuals who are former incarcerated firefighters. \n",
