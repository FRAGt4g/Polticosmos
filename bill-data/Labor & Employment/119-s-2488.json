    "summary": "The Empowering App-Based Workers Act aims to increase transparency and accountability for digital labor platforms. It mandates disclosures to app-based workers and consumers regarding the use of electronic monitoring tools and automated decision systems. The bill addresses algorithmic wage setting, establishes a take rate cap for on-demand transportation services, and provides whistleblower protections. It also grants workers, consumers, and authorized agents a private right of action for violations, and allows the Secretary of Labor to enforce the Act with civil monetary penalties. The goal is to prevent exploitation and ensure fair treatment in the gig economy.",
