    "summary": "The Empowering Striking Workers Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act to allow individuals involved in labor disputes to receive unemployment benefits. This includes workers on strike or locked out, as well as those indirectly affected by the dispute. Benefits would begin after a waiting period or when certain conditions are met, such as the hiring of replacement workers or the end of the dispute. The bill also modifies the Social Security Act to exempt these claimants from certain work availability requirements.",
