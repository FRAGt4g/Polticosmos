    "summary": "The Pensions for All Act mandates that all employers provide employees with a retirement program comparable to the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) or allow employees to participate in FERS. The bill defines terms, amends relevant sections of the U.S. Code, and offers tax credits for small employer and self-employed pension contributions. It also imposes a tax on employers and self-employed individuals who fail to maintain the required retirement program. Finally, it prohibits employers from reducing employee compensation due to the new requirements.",
