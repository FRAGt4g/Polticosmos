    "summary": "The Pathways to Paychecks Act (S.2864) aims to amend the Wagner-Peyser Act to give states more flexibility in staffing their employment service offices. Specifically, it allows states to use state merit staff or other staff meeting federal contractor requirements to fulfill the duties of these offices, rather than mandating a specific staffing model. The bill was introduced by Mr. Cassidy on September 18, 2025, and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.",
