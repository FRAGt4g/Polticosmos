    "summary": "This bill, the Reducing the Federal Workforce Through Attrition Act, aims to reduce the size of the federal workforce through attrition. It mandates a hiring freeze, allowing agencies to only hire one employee for every three who leave, starting in fiscal year 2026. The bill sets a target of reducing the total number of federal employees to 90% of the 2025 level by fiscal year 2028.  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will monitor agencies for compliance and notify the President and Congress if an agency exceeds its allowable employee limit, triggering a series of hiring restrictions. Waivers are allowed for emergencies or national security concerns. The bill also includes provisions aimed to limit the shift of work to service contracts during the workforce reduction.",
