    "summary": "This bill, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act, aims to provide collective bargaining rights for public safety officers (law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency medical services personnel) at the state and local levels. It establishes a framework for the Federal Labor Relations Authority to determine if states substantially provide these rights, including the right to form and join unions, bargain over wages and working conditions, and access binding arbitration. If a state doesn't meet these standards, the Authority will issue regulations. The bill also addresses existing agreements and prohibits strikes that disrupt emergency services.",
