    "summary": "This bill, the Union Auto Workers Job Protection Act, aims to protect workers in the motor vehicle industry. It mandates that federal agencies require detailed information about motor vehicle plants where vehicles for government contracts are assembled, including wages, labor violations, and plant locations. The legislation also restricts the use of federal funds for purchasing delivery vehicles unless the contractor agrees to a union neutrality agreement. The bill seeks to ensure fair labor practices and transparency in federal procurement.",
