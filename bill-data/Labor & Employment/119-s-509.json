    "summary": "The 'Future Logging Careers Act' aims to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exempt 16- and 17-year-olds employed in certain logging operations from child labor laws. The bill defines both 'logging operation' and 'mechanized operation', outlining the specific activities and equipment covered.  The exemption would not apply to hazardous occupations as determined by the Secretary of Labor, and further exempts those employed by their parents in logging operations owned and/or operated by parents.",
