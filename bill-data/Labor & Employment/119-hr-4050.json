    "summary": "The Advancing Skills-Based Hiring Act of 2025 aims to promote skills-based hiring by establishing a voluntary compliance assistance initiative at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). This will allow employers to proactively submit validation information regarding employment tests and selection procedures to the EEOC for review. The EEOC will determine if the procedures are job-related and consistent with business necessity. Employers can obtain a 'safe harbor' by having their assessments reviewed. The bill also mandates education and technical assistance on the appropriate usage of employment tests and selection, ultimately fostering more equitable hiring practices.",
