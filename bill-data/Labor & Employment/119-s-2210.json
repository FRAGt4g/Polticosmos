    "summary": "The 'Unlocking Benefits for Independent Workers Act' aims to clarify employment status under federal law. It stipulates that providing portable benefits to an individual, such as those that can be maintained even after the work relationship ends, or benefits commonly offered to full-time employees, should not be a factor in determining whether that individual is classified as an employee. The bill seeks to ensure independent workers can receive certain benefits without impacting their worker classification.",
