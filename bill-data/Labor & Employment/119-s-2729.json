    "summary": "The Nationwide Right To Unionize Act, introduced in the Senate on September 4, 2025, aims to repeal the provision in the National Labor Relations Act that allows states to enact \"right-to-work\" laws. These laws currently prohibit agreements that require union membership as a condition of employment. The bill seeks to invalidate these state-level restrictions, potentially strengthening the power of labor unions and expanding worker rights nationwide.",
