    "summary": "The Secret Ballot Protection Act (H.R. 2241) amends the National Labor Relations Act to require secret ballot elections for union recognition. The bill mandates that unions must be selected by a majority of employees in a secret ballot election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). It also requires secret ballot elections for decertification of unions and directs the NLRB to revise its regulations accordingly. Existing collective bargaining relationships are grandfathered in. The stated purpose is to ensure employee choice is free from coercion and to promote a strong national economy.",
