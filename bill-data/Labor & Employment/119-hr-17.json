    "summary": "The Paycheck Fairness Act amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to combat wage discrimination based on sex. It strengthens equal pay protections by narrowing the legal justifications for pay gaps and expanding the definition of 'sex' to include sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill enhances non-retaliation provisions for employees who discuss wages, allows for compensatory and punitive damages, and facilitates class-action lawsuits. It also prohibits employers from seeking or relying on a prospective employee's salary history and directs federal agencies to collect detailed pay data to improve enforcement and transparency.",
