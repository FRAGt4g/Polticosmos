    "summary": "The Saving the Civil Service Act aims to limit the ability of federal agencies to except positions from the competitive service and transfer positions between the competitive and excepted services. The bill places restrictions on which schedules positions can be placed in, requires employee consent for certain transfers, and mandates an annual report to Congress detailing any such transfers and any violations of the act. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is required to issue implementing regulations within 90 days of the act's enactment.",
