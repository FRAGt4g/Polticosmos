    "summary": "The Empowering Striking Workers Act of 2025 amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act to allow individuals engaged in a labor dispute to receive unemployment benefits. This includes workers unable to work due to a strike or lockout, or as an indirect result of such a dispute. Benefits would begin after a waiting period, or when the employer hired permanent replacements or when the strike/lockout ended. This aims to provide financial support to striking workers.",
