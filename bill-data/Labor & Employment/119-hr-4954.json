    "summary": "The Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025 aims to prevent the outsourcing of call center jobs. It mandates the Secretary of Labor to maintain a public list of companies relocating call centers or contracting work overseas and makes these companies ineligible for federal grants and loans for five years. Furthermore, it requires companies engaging in customer service communications to disclose the physical location of their agents and provides consumers with the option to be transferred to a US-based agent. The bill also places requirements on federal contractors to perform call center work within the United States.",
