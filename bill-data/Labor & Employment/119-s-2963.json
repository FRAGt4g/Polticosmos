    "summary": "The Fair Pay for Federal Contractors Act of 2025 mandates that federal agencies compensate contractors for costs incurred due to lapses in appropriations that led to furloughs, layoffs, reduced hours, or reduced pay for contractor employees. Agencies are required to adjust contract prices to provide back compensation to affected employees, up to a weekly limit. The bill also appropriates funds for this purpose and requires the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to report to Congress on the adjustments made.",
