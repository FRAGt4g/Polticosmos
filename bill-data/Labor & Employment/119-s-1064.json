    "summary": "This bill, the Fair and Open Competition Act (FOCA Act), aims to promote open competition and Federal Government neutrality in the labor relations of contractors on federal and federally-funded construction projects. It prohibits government agencies from requiring or prohibiting contractors from agreements with labor organizations and prevents discrimination based on labor affiliation. The bill allows for exemptions based on specific circumstances, and defines relevant terms like \"construction contract\" and \"labor organization\". It also requires revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement its provisions.",
