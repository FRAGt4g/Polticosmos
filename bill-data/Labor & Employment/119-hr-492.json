    "summary": "The Saving the Civil Service Act (H.R. 492) aims to protect federal government employees from politicization. It prohibits the creation of 'Schedule F,' a proposed job category that would weaken civil service protections. The bill limits the reclassification of positions from the merit-based competitive service to specific, pre-existing excepted service schedules (A-E) as they were defined in September 2020. It further strengthens job security by requiring employee consent for certain transfers and capping the number of positions an agency can reclassify from the competitive service during a four-year presidential term.",
