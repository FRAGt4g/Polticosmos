    "summary": "The Faster Labor Contracts Act (H.R. 5408) aims to expedite the collective bargaining process for labor organizations. It amends the National Labor Relations Act to require quicker initial bargaining after union certification or recognition.  The bill mandates a timeline for bargaining and mediation, and if no agreement is reached, it outlines a process for binding arbitration.  It also mandates a GAO report to track the time it takes to reach initial collective bargaining agreements.  The intent is to ensure workers quickly secure initial contracts.",
