    "summary": "The \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025\" aims to prevent the outsourcing of call center jobs. It mandates that employers notify the Secretary of Labor before relocating call centers or contracting work overseas and creates a public list of these companies. Companies on the list become ineligible for federal grants/loans. Furthermore, the bill requires customer service agents to disclose their physical location, including a right for consumers to be transferred to a US-based agent, and requires disclosure of AI use. The Federal Trade Commission will enforce the regulations.",
