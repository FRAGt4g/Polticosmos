    "summary": "This bill, the \"Balance the Scales Act,\" amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). It mandates that the Employee Benefit Security Administration (EBSA) submit an annual report to Congress detailing agreements to provide adverse assistance, defined as assistance or advice to attorneys for potential use in civil actions regarding employee benefit plans. The bill outlines specific information to be included in the report, such as copies of agreements, dates, descriptions of assistance, and logs of communications and meetings. It also amends ERISA to further recognize the importance of private pension plans for employee security and well-being, promoting their voluntary sponsorship and maintenance.",
