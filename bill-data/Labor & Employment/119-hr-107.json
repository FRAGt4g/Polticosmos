    "summary": "The 'Return to Work Act' (H.R. 107) mandates that all federal Executive agencies must reinstate the telework policies that were in effect on December 31, 2019. This change must be implemented within 60 days of the bill's enactment. The bill specifies that these reinstated pre-pandemic policies will override any conflicting remote work provisions in existing employment or collective bargaining agreements. The legislation effectively aims to curtail expanded telework options for federal employees that were established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and bring more workers back to physical government offices.",
