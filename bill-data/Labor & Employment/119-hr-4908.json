    "summary": "The 'Time Off to Vote Act' mandates that employers provide a minimum of two consecutive hours of paid leave to employees to vote in federal elections. Employers can specify the time for the leave, potentially during early voting. The bill prohibits interference with voting rights, retaliation against employees exercising these rights, and sets civil penalties for violations. The Secretary of Labor has investigative authority and enforcement mechanisms. State and local laws offering more generous leave are not superseded. This Act takes effect with the first federal election after its enactment.",
