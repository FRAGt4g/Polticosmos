    "summary": "The Independent Retirement Fairness Act aims to improve retirement plan access and benefits for independent workers. It amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code to allow independent workers to participate in pooled employer plans and simplified employee pensions (SEPs). The bill defines 'independent worker', provides data harmonization, clarifies employment status, and introduces pilot programs to encourage retirement savings through automation and bonus contributions.",
