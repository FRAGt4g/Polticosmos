    "summary": "This bill, the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act of 2025, aims to secure the rights of public employees to organize, act concertedly, and bargain collectively. It establishes federal minimum standards for collective bargaining, including rights to self-organization, employer recognition of unions, and interest impasse resolution. The Federal Labor Relations Authority will determine if state laws substantially provide these rights; if not, the Authority will administer the federal standards. The bill also prohibits lockouts and strikes affecting emergency/public safety services.",
