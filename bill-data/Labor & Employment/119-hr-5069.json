    "summary": "This bill, the Peter J. McGuire Labor Day Landmark Act, seeks to designate the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Gravesite in Pennsauken, New Jersey, as the \"Peter J. McGuire Memorial National Commemorative Site.\" It recognizes McGuire's significant contributions to the labor movement, including founding the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and the American Federation of Labor, and his role in establishing Labor Day. The bill outlines the site's designation and potential for cooperative agreements and assistance, while clarifying it's not part of the National Park System and doesn't restrict property owner actions.",
