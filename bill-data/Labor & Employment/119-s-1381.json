    "summary": "The 'Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2025' amends US bankruptcy law to strengthen protections for employees and retirees. It prioritizes wage claims, severance, and benefit contributions, and provides remedies for stock losses in defined contribution plans. The bill restricts executive compensation, enhances scrutiny of collective bargaining agreement rejections, and protects employee benefits during asset sales. It also aims to maintain going concern value and job preservation during reorganizations. ",
