    "summary": "The Modernizing Access to Public Roads Act (MAP Roads Act) aims to establish a grant program for states to digitize county roads and create publicly accessible road datasets. The bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to oversee this pilot program, providing funds for states to support rural commerce, improve public safety, and enhance access and navigation. States will apply for grants, which will be awarded based on criteria including the identification of deficiencies in digitized roads, capacity to administer subgrants, and commitment to data standards. The bill also details reporting requirements, definitions, savings clauses, and authorization of appropriations, with a sunset provision.",
