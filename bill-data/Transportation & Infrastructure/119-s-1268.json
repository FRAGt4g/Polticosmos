    "summary": "The Safety Starts at the Top Act of 2025 amends Title 49 of the United States Code concerning aviation safety. It revises the qualifications for Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) holders, particularly focusing on entities with substantial annual revenue. These entities are required to have representatives from labor unions and those with aerospace safety experience on their boards of directors. The bill also mandates the Federal Aviation Administration to review and rescind delegations to entities that don't meet these new requirements.",
