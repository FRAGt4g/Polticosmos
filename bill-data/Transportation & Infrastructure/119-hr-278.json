    "summary": "The \"BROADBAND Leadership Act\" (H.R. 278) seeks to accelerate broadband deployment by streamlining the siting process for telecommunications facilities. It amends the Communications Act of 1934 to impose strict timelines on state and local governments for approving or denying construction permits: 90 days for existing infrastructure and 150 for new builds. If a government misses this deadline, the request is automatically \"deemed granted.\" The bill prohibits discriminatory regulations based on technology, establishes rules for reasonable and transparent fees, and provides for expedited judicial review to remove local barriers to telecommunications expansion.",
