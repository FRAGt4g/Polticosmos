    "summary": "The Noncontiguous Shipping Relief Act of 2024 aims to amend U.S. law to allow foreign-flag vessels to transport merchandise in noncontiguous trade, primarily within areas like Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. territories. The bill defines foreign qualified freight vessels, outlines requirements for citizenship and transfer provisions, addresses labor standards and compensation, and establishes environmental and regulatory standards for all vessels in the coastwise trade. It also sets requirements for non-U.S. citizens engaging in domestic coastwise trade. The key goal is to ease shipping restrictions and potentially lower costs for these typically underserved markets.",
