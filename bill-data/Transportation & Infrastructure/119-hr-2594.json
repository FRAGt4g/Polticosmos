    "summary": "This bill, HR 2594, aims to establish a Water Risk and Resilience Organization (WRRO) to develop and implement cybersecurity risk and resilience requirements for the water sector. The WRRO will be certified by the EPA and will create standards for covered water systems (those serving populations of at least 3,300), including requirements for cyber resilience and incident response. The bill outlines the WRRO's responsibilities, including monitoring and assessment, and grants it the power to impose penalties for violations. The EPA will review and approve the WRRO's requirements. This aims to protect water systems from cyber threats and ensure public safety.",
