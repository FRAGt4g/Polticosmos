    "summary": "The Highway Funding Flexibility Act of 2025 aims to optimize the use of federal funds allocated for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. It redirects unobligated funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the charging and fueling infrastructure grant program to other highway projects, bridge repairs, wildlife crossing structures, parking for commercial motor vehicles, and related engineering services.  It also dictates how future funds for these programs should be distributed and used, emphasizing distribution to states based on existing apportionment formulas. The bill mandates these funds are subject to specific requirements and limitations.",
