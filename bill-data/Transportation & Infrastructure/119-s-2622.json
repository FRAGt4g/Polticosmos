    "summary": "The Space Ready Act (S. 2622) authorizes the NASA Administrator to establish a pilot program for public and private investment in infrastructure projects at the Kennedy Space Center. It also establishes the Infrastructure Investment Fund, funded by assessments on agreements supporting commercial activities at the Center. The Fund will be used for capital repairs, maintenance, and improvements to NASA-owned infrastructure. The bill mandates annual reports on the Fund's activities and sets a termination date for the assessment authority. All improvements become property of the United States.",
