    "summary": "The Stronger Communities through Better Transit Act (H.R. 3449) proposes to amend Title 49, United States Code, to establish a program providing grants to eligible recipients for public transportation operating support. The bill allocates funding via formula based on operating costs, with specific provisions for urbanized areas, states, and Indian Tribes. Funds can be used for various improvements, particularly those benefiting underserved communities. The bill also increases the federal share for operating costs in rural areas and mandates reporting requirements and a GAO report on the program's outcomes. The bill further increases the role of public transportation in combating climate change.",
