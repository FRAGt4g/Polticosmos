    "summary": "The 'AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act of 2025' mandates that the Secretary of Transportation issue a rule requiring AM radio functionality as standard equipment in all new passenger motor vehicles. The bill aims to ensure access to AM broadcast stations for emergency alerts and public information. It also includes provisions for a GAO study on emergency alert dissemination, a review of the rule's impact on public safety, and a sunset clause. The goal is to enhance the public's access to vital information, especially in emergency scenarios, by utilizing the AM radio band. The rule must be implemented within two to three years of being issued, with exceptions for smaller manufacturers.",
