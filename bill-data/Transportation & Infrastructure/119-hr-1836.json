    "summary": "The 'Granting Remaining Applications Not Treated Efficiently or Delayed Act of 2025' (aka the GRANTED Act) amends the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. It aims to expedite the approval process for applications for federal easements, rights-of-way, and leases related to communications facility installations. The bill stipulates that if an executive agency fails to grant or deny a complete application by a specified deadline, the application is automatically deemed granted. It defines a complete application and when it is considered received, ensuring timely consideration and preventing unnecessary delays.",
