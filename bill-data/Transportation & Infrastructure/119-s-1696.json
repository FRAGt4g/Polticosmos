    "summary": "This bill, the Deregulating Restrictions on Interstate Vehicles and Eighteen-wheelers Act (DRIVE Act), aims to prevent the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) from mandating the use of speed-limiting devices on commercial motor vehicles. It directly prohibits the FMCSA Administrator from issuing rules or regulations that would require these devices, effectively blocking a potential requirement for trucks to have their speed capped. The bill was introduced in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.",
