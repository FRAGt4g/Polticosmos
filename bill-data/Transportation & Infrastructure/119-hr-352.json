The bill proposes an amendment to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. This amendment would specifically prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from establishing or maintaining \"cordon pricing\"\u2014a system of charging vehicles to enter a specific area\u2014for the Central Business District Tolling Program in New York City. The legislation effectively seeks to use federal law to block the city's plan to toll vehicles entering a designated zone in Manhattan.",
