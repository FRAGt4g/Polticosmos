    "summary": "This bill, the 'Streamlining Permitting to Enable Efficient Deployment for Broadband Infrastructure Act of 2025,' aims to expedite the deployment of broadband internet infrastructure. It amends the Communications Act of 1934 to exempt certain communications facility projects from environmental and historical preservation reviews under NEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act. Exemptions apply to new facilities in public rights-of-way, replacements of existing facilities, specific antenna types, and site expansions, provided they meet certain criteria. The act defines key terms, including 'communications facility,' 'covered project,' and 'public right-of-way,' and includes a savings clause to preserve the FCC's radiofrequency exposure evaluation obligation and state and local zoning authority.",
