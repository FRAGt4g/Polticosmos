    "summary": "This bill, the \"Protecting Infrastructure Investments for Rural America Act,\" amends the rural surface transportation grant program to better serve smaller communities. It redefines a rural area as being outside an urbanized area with 30,000 or fewer people and creates a new \"small community\" category for those with populations of 5,000 or less. The bill mandates that at least 5% of program funds be used for these small communities, increases the federal cost share for their projects to 90%, and expands project eligibility to include those fostering local economic growth and quality of life.",
