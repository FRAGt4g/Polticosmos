    "summary": "The Urban Canal Modernization Act amends the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 to authorize extraordinary operation and maintenance work for urban canals deemed 'urban canals of concern.' It defines these canals based on potential at-risk populations and Secretary of the Interior determination. The bill outlines cost-sharing for this work, with the Secretary providing 35% non-reimbursable funds and the remainder to be repaid by the operating entity.  It also clarifies that reimbursable funds are considered non-Federal for grant cost-sharing.",
