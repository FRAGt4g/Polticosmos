    "summary": "The Groundwater Rise and Infrastructure Preparedness Act of 2025 mandates the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to map and forecast groundwater rise in coastal areas, projecting through 2100. It also requires a study by the National Academies, in two phases, assessing the impact of groundwater rise on infrastructure, including roads, buildings, and utilities, and on public health, including contamination and drinking water threats. The bill includes funding for the program and directs the creation of a public website for the maps and related information, with a final report to Congress.",
