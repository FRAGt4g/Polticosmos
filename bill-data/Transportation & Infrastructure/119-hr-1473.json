    "summary": "The Postal Processing Protection Act aims to place specific requirements on the United States Postal Service when closing facilities that support post offices. The bill amends Section 404(d) of title 39, United States Code, to extend the existing regulations regarding post office closures to include acceptance, processing, shipping, delivery, distribution and other facilities. This ensures these facilities, which support post offices or parts therof, are subject to the same review process before closure.",
