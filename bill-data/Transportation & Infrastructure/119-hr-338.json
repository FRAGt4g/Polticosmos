    "summary": "The \"Every Drop Counts Act\" (H.R. 338) amends the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to expand eligibility for federal grants for water storage projects. The bill redefines eligible projects to include those with specific water storage capacities (e.g., 200 to 30,000 acre-feet) or those that achieve significant annual groundwater recharge. The goal is to increase both surface and groundwater storage, convey water more effectively, and stabilize groundwater levels. The legislation, introduced with bipartisan support, explicitly states it will not supersede existing state water laws or private water rights.",
