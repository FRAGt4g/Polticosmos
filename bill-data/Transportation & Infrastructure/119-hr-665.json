    "summary": "The Noncontiguous Shipping Competition Act (H.R. 665) aims to amend U.S. law to exempt certain noncontiguous trade from the coastwise laws. The bill specifically focuses on routes in noncontiguous trade, allowing exemptions unless certain conditions are met, such as the presence of multiple owners/operators of coastwise qualified vessels regularly operating on that route and controlling a significant portion of the goods transported. The Act's primary goal appears to be fostering competition in shipping.",
