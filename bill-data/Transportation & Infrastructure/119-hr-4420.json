    "summary": "The Cool Corridors Act of 2025 aims to enhance the resilience, accessibility, and safety of the nation's transportation corridors. It reauthorizes and amends the Healthy Streets program, focusing on investments in tree canopies, shade infrastructure, and other nature-based cooling strategies along pedestrian, bicycle, and transit routes. The bill expands eligible entities, defines \"cool corridors\" and \"heat mitigation strategies,\" and outlines grant requirements for project implementation, community engagement, and reporting. It also mandates interagency coordination and technical assistance, while addressing tree planting specifications and the development of a report to evaluate program outcomes and recommend permanent authorization.",
