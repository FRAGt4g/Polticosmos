    "summary": "The International Bridge and Port of Entry Modernization Act of 2025 (IBEM Act of 2025) aims to streamline the Presidential permitting process for international bridges and land ports of entry. It amends the International Bridge Act of 1972, removing a time restriction, specifying types of projects covered (US-Mexico & US-Canada bridges and ports), clarifying permitting procedures, and preventing the Secretary from compiling environmental documents for Presidential permits. The bill seeks to expedite infrastructure projects related to border crossings.",
