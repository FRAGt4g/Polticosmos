    "summary": "The 'End Driving While Intoxicated Act of 2025' mandates a national standard for ignition interlocks for DWI offenders. It amends Title 23 of the United States Code, requiring states to enact and enforce laws that mandate ignition interlocks for a minimum of 180 days for DWI offenders. States failing to comply will have a percentage of their federal transportation funding withheld. The bill defines key terms like 'driving while intoxicated' and 'ignition interlock,' and includes clauses related to fund apportionment, compliance, and non-compliance, aiming to reduce drunk driving fatalities.",
