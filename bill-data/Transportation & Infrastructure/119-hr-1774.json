    "summary": "This bill, HR 1774, aims to amend Title 23 of the United States Code by withholding certain federal funds from the District of Columbia. This withholding is contingent upon the Mayor of D.C. removing the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" from the street symbolically designated as Black Lives Matter Plaza (and redesignating it as Liberty Plaza), as well as removing the phrase from all D.C. websites, documents, and other materials. The Secretary of Transportation will withhold 50 percent of apportioned funds if the mayor doesn't comply within 60 days of the bill's enactment.",
