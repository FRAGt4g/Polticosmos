    "summary": "The Open America's Ports Act (S. 2537) aims to adjust regulations for passenger vessels operating in U.S. waters.  It repeals the Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886 (PVSA) domestic requirements and modifies Jones Act requirements and citizenship/Navy Reserve requirements for passenger vessels. The bill clarifies that these changes do not exempt vessels from all U.S. laws, except as specifically amended. The primary goal is to change requirements for passenger vessels and facilitate travel.",
