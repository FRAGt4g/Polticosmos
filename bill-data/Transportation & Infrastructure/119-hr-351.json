    "summary": "H.R. 351, introduced by Rep. Malliotakis, seeks to amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. The bill would explicitly prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from establishing or maintaining federal value pricing programs that include congestion pricing or cordon pricing. These strategies involve charging fees to drivers to use roads during peak hours or to enter specific high-traffic zones, with the goal of reducing traffic. This legislation would effectively prevent the use of these specific tolling methods as a tool for traffic management under the authority of this particular federal program.",
