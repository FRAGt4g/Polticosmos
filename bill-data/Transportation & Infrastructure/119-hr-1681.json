    "summary": "This bill, the Expediting Federal Broadband Deployment Reviews Act, aims to speed up the process of approving requests for communications infrastructure on federal lands. It mandates the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to establish an interagency strike force. This strike force, composed of various federal agency heads, will prioritize and streamline the review of communications use authorizations (e.g., easements, licenses) on public and National Forest System lands. The strike force will set goals and monitor progress, reporting to Congress on its effectiveness. The bill defines various terms related to communications facilities, land, and the involved agencies.",
