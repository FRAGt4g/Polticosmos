    "summary": "The 'Safe Operations of Shared Airspace Act of 2025' addresses aviation safety. It mandates an expert panel review of the FAA's Safety Management System (SMS) and requires ADS-B In equipment on certain aircraft. The bill also initiates safety reviews of airspace, particularly near airports with mixed traffic, and mandates information sharing between the FAA and the Department of Defense. It includes provisions to improve air traffic controller training, address employee reporting, and manage potential conflicts of interest, as well as reforms to ADS-B Out exceptions.",
