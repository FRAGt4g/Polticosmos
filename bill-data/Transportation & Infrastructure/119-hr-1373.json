    "summary": "The Tennessee Valley Authority Transparency Act of 2025 aims to increase transparency in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The bill mandates that TVA board meetings, committee meetings, and subcommittee meetings (where votes aren't scheduled) be open to the public. It requires public notice of at least six days before such meetings, through the TVA website, and mandates the public availability of meeting minutes and summaries. Emergency meetings are exempted from the notice requirement.",
