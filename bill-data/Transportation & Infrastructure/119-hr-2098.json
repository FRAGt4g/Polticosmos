    "summary": "The Deliver for Democracy Act aims to ensure timely delivery of periodicals by the United States Postal Service. It mandates that the Postal Regulatory Commission withhold additional rate authority for periodicals if the USPS doesn't meet specific on-time delivery performance standards. The bill also requires the Postmaster General to submit annual reports on periodical service performance, including data for in-county and out-of-county newspaper mail. Finally, the Comptroller General is tasked with a study on alternative pricing schemes to improve the financial position of periodicals.",
