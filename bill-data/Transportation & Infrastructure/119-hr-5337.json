    "summary": "The Motor Carrier Safety Selection Standard Act of 2024 aims to establish a national standard for entities contracting with motor carriers. It defines criteria for determining if a covered entity has exercised reasonable care in selecting a motor carrier for transporting goods. The bill mandates verifying registration, insurance coverage, and FMCSA safety compliance. The Secretary of Transportation is required to amend regulations for motor carrier safety fitness determinations. Individual shippers are exempt from certain requirements. The Act includes definitions for key terms like 'covered entity' and 'covered motor carrier.'",
