    "summary": "This bill, the 'More Opportunities for Rural Economies from DOT Grants Act,' aims to improve access to Department of Transportation (DOT) grants for rural communities, particularly those with a significant amount of federal land and populations under 100,000. It defines 'High-Density Public Land County' and 'Qualifying Grant Programs,' which include various infrastructure-related grants. The bill reduces local matching fund requirements by 50% for these counties and provides technical assistance. It prioritizes grant applications from underserved areas and allows for special consideration and support, addressing potential barriers in the application process related to numerical scoring, partnership requirements, financial constraints, and application complexity.",
