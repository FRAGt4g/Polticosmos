    "summary": "The Bus Parity and Clarity Act aims to clarify and expand equal access for over-the-road buses. It amends Title 23 of the United States Code to ensure these buses have equal access to toll roads, bridges, tunnels, ferries, and HOV facilities as public transportation vehicles. The bill defines \"charter service\" and mandates the Federal Highway Administration to publish a unified database detailing rates, terms, and conditions for toll facilities. This also impacts value pricing pilot programs.",
