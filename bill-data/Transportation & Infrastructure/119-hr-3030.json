    "summary": "The Highway Formula Fairness Act aims to amend United States Code Title 23 regarding highway funding. It proposes a discretionary increase in highway funding for states experiencing population growth, based on the relative increase in population. Furthermore, the bill mandates a study by the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, to modernize the highway funding formula, assess its equity, and provide recommendations for a new apportionment method. This includes evaluating existing factors, data accuracy, and relevant measures, with a report to Congress within 90 days of enactment.",
