    "summary": "The Bus Rolling Stock Modernization Act of 2025 aims to establish limitations on advanced payments for bus rolling stock. It amends Section 5323 of Title 49, United States Code, to allow recipients to use federal assistance for advance payments on bus vehicles without pre-approval or performance bonds, provided certain conditions are met, including a signed contract and preaward authority. However, advance payments are limited to no more than 20% of the total purchase order value.",
