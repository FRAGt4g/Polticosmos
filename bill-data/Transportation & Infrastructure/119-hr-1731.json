    "summary": "This bill, the \"Standard Fees to Expedite Evaluation and Streamlining Act\" (Standard FEES Act), amends the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. It mandates the Administrator of General Services to create a uniform fee schedule for processing applications related to placing communications facilities on federal property. The bill outlines fee guidelines based on agency costs and competitive neutrality, with exceptions for public benefit and broadband expansion. Executive agencies must adopt these fees and exceptions, with collected fees designated for processing costs. Notably, the Administrator must establish the fee schedule within 30 days of the Act\u2019s enactment and executive agencies must adopt it within 120 days of its establishment.",
