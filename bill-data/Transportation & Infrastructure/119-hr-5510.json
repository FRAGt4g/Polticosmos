    "summary": "This bill, the United States\u2013Mexican War Memorial Act of 2025, proposes to co-designate Arlington Memorial Bridge as the United States-Mexican War Memorial. It authorizes limited interpretive enhancements like signage and plaques, and mandates that these additions align with historic preservation and environmental regulations. The Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park Service, will administer the co-designation. The bill prohibits the use of federal funds for the commemorative elements, but allows for accepting donations. It aims to commemorate the war without impacting bridge operations or altering its name. ",
