    "summary": "The 'Improving Interagency Coordination for Pipeline Reviews Act' aims to streamline the review process for natural gas pipeline authorizations. It designates the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as the lead agency for NEPA reviews, mandates early coordination with other involved agencies, and promotes deference to FERC's NEPA review. The bill establishes deadlines, promotes concurrent reviews by various agencies, allows for remote data gathering, and requires public access to information regarding the application process, including schedules and delays. It also addresses water quality impacts and pipeline security, seeking to expedite decision-making while ensuring proper environmental and security considerations.",
