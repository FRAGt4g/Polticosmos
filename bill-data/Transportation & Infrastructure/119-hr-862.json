    "summary": "The TSA Commuting Fairness Act proposes a feasibility study on treating the time Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees spend commuting between their duty locations and airport parking/transit stops as on-duty hours. The study, to be submitted to relevant House and Senate committees within 270 days, will consider factors like commute times, potential benefits, cost implications and the use of technology for tracking. The main goal of the act is to reduce commuting burdens on TSA employees.",
