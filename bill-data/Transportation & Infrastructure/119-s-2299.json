    "summary": "The Resilient Transit Act of 2025 amends Title 49 of the United States Code to authorize grants for public transportation resilience improvements. These grants will help state and local government authorities finance projects to protect public transit systems from climate change impacts like flooding and extreme weather. The bill defines key terms like 'resilience improvement', 'environmental justice community', and specifies eligible activities, including infrastructure upgrades and vulnerability assessments. It also mandates annual reports to Congress, focusing on project implementation and benefits to underserved communities, and it amends funding authorizations for the relevant programs.",
