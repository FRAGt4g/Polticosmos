    "summary": "This bill, the 'Securities and Exchange Commission Real Estate Leasing Authority Revocation Act,' revokes the SEC's independent authority to lease its own general-purpose office space. This responsibility would be transferred to the General Services Administration (GSA). The bill ensures that any leases the SEC entered into before the act's enactment remain valid. Additionally, it directs the Comptroller General to update a 2016 report for Congress that reviews which federal agencies possess independent leasing authority, how they use it, and the status of related reform recommendations.",
