    "summary": "The \"HOV Lanes for Heroes Act\" (H.R. 234) proposes amending U.S. law to allow public authorities to grant disabled veterans access to High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, even if they are the sole occupant. To qualify, a veteran must have a service-connected disability rating (at a level determined by the local authority) and be identifiable via a special license plate or transponder. The bill also gives public authorities the option to waive any tolls for these veterans, aiming to provide a significant transportation benefit for those with service-connected disabilities.",
