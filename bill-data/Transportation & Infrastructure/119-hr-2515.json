    "summary": "The American Tank Car Modernization Act of 2025 aims to improve freight railcar safety and efficiency through the adoption of telematics systems. The bill establishes grant programs for railcar owners to purchase and install these systems, which will provide real-time data on railcar location, asset health, and enable the development of sensor technologies. The bill prioritizes the installation of these systems based on new builds, certification events, and the type of railcar service, as well as freight railcar type. It also mandates a pilot program to aid in the development of onboard sensor technology and requires reports on the programs' progress. The bill authorizes appropriations for these initiatives.",
