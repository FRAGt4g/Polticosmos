    "summary": "The 'All Aboard Act' aims to improve Amtrak service and passenger satisfaction. It mandates the Secretary of Transportation to create regulations for Amtrak to refund passengers for canceled or significantly delayed rail transportation due to Amtrak's failures. The bill also requires Amtrak to submit a report on alternative asset maintenance strategies to replace the 'run-to-fail' model, banning the model within two years and mandating the implementation of a new strategy. The bill defines key terms like 'covered rail passenger transportation' and 'run-to-fail maintenance model.'",
