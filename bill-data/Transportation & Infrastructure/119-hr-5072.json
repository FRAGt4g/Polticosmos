    "summary": "The Water Crisis Prevention Act of 2025 mandates the Comptroller General of the United States to review existing FEMA funding for water infrastructure failure disasters, including those with and without emergency declarations. The review, to be completed within six months of enactment, will focus on funding eligibility for states, localities, individuals, and small businesses. A report to Congress will detail the findings and offer recommendations for federal-state partnerships to identify at-risk areas and for congressional funding to mitigate future disasters by addressing vulnerable water infrastructure.",
