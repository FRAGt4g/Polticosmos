    "summary": "The \"Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act\" (H.R. 131) modifies the repayment terms for a major water infrastructure project in Colorado. The bill makes the repayment interest-free, extends the payment period to 100 years, and specifies that the repayment must consist of non-federal funds provided during the construction phase. By easing the financial burden on local partners, the legislation aims to expedite the completion of the conduit, which is intended to deliver clean drinking water to communities in southeastern Colorado.",
