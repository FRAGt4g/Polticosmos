    "summary": "The \"Train Furtherance of Outstanding Onboard Dining Act\" (Train FOOD Act) directs Amtrak to improve its food and beverage service based on recommendations from an existing working group. It requires Amtrak to establish an advisory committee and submit annual public reports to Congress detailing progress on these recommendations. The reports must identify completed items, justify any impractical recommendations with cost estimates if needed, and describe changes to the service. The bill also mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report within two years to assess Amtrak's progress, ensuring oversight and transparency.",
