    "summary": "The Highway Funding Flexibility Act of 2025 aims to optimize the use of federal funds allocated for electric vehicle charging infrastructure programs. It allows unobligated funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the charging and fueling infrastructure grant program to be used for various highway projects, including road construction, bridge repair, wildlife crossing structures, and commercial motor vehicle parking. The bill also reallocates future funds, distributing them to states based on their existing apportionment for highway projects. The act is designed to ensure efficient use of infrastructure funds.",
