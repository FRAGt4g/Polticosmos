    "summary": "The Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Active Transportation Safety Act (S. 944) amends Title 23 of the United States Code related to highway safety improvement programs. It focuses on improving safety for bicyclists and pedestrians. The bill allows for increased federal funding (up to 100%) for projects connecting existing bicyclist/pedestrian infrastructure and reducing safety risks to vulnerable road users. It also modifies how the non-Federal share of certain projects is calculated and includes a provision for increased federal funding for proven safety countermeasures for bicyclists and pedestrians.",
