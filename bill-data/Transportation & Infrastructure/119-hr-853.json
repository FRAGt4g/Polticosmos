    "summary": "The 'Assistance for Local Heroes During Train Crises Act' addresses hazardous train events. It establishes a Hazardous Train Event Emergency Reimbursement Fund to reimburse local emergency responders for costs incurred during such events. The bill defines key terms, outlines the Administrator's declaration process, provides for initial and additional funding, and mandates documentation of costs. It also requires advance warning and real-time location information from railroads transporting hazardous materials to local emergency response groups, and institutes an annual fee for shippers and carriers of hazardous materials, with proceeds going to the reimbursement fund.",
