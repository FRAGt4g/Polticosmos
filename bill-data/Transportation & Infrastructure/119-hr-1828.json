    "summary": "The School Bus Safety Act of 2025 mandates several safety enhancements for school buses. It requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue rules for 3-point seat belts, fire suppression systems, and other safety equipment like automatic emergency braking and event data recorders. Additionally, it calls for studies on motion-activated detection systems and safety belt alerts. A grant program is established to help local educational agencies purchase or modify school buses with these safety features.",
