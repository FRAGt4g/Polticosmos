    "summary": "This bill, H.R. 279, addresses a tax allocation issue for the unincorporated community of Fairlawn, Virginia. Because Fairlawn shares ZIP Codes with the neighboring independent city of Radford, sales tax revenue from e-commerce is often misallocated to Radford instead of Pulaski County, where Fairlawn is located. To resolve this, the bill directs the U.S. Postal Service to designate a single, unique ZIP Code for Fairlawn within 180 days of the bill's enactment. This is intended to ensure the correct distribution of tax revenue.",
