It amends Title 46 of the United States Code to mandate that the Secretary of Transportation, or recipients of financing, take steps to ensure 100% of applicable cargo tonnage is shipped on U.S. vessels, contingent on availability at fair rates and fostering fair participation across geographic areas.",
