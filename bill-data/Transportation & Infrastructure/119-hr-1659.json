    "summary": "The Truck Parking Safety Improvement Act (H.R. 1659) aims to address the shortage of commercial motor vehicle parking on the Federal-aid highway system. It establishes a competitive grant program for projects to provide public parking for commercial motor vehicles, improve driver safety, and promote the efficient movement of freight. Eligible entities, including states and local governments, can apply for grants to construct or improve parking facilities, with considerations for geographic distribution and operational sustainability. The bill also mandates reports on parking availability and project effectiveness and authorizes $151 million annually from 2025-2029 for the program.",
