    "summary": "The Bridging the Broadband Gap Act of 2025 amends the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to allow recipients of Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program funds to provide broadband vouchers to households in areas lacking adequate broadband access. These vouchers can be used to cover the costs of broadband equipment and monthly service fees, with priority given to low-income households in unserved or underserved locations. The bill defines eligible costs and service types, focusing on satellite and fixed wireless broadband. Voucher availability is limited to a single 12-month period for equipment lease costs.",
