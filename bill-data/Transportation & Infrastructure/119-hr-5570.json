    "summary": "The Rail Passenger Fairness Act aims to improve Amtrak's on-time performance by allowing Amtrak to directly sue in federal court to enforce its right to priority over freight trains on rail lines. The bill cites poor on-time performance due to freight train interference, leading to significant delays and cost inefficiencies. It highlights the historical effectiveness of enforcement mechanisms and seeks to empower Amtrak to uphold its congressionally mandated mission to provide on-time service.",
