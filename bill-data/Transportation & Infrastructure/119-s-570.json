    "summary": "This bill, the Water Infrastructure Subcontractor and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2025, amends the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014. It mandates payment and performance security for projects funded under the Act. The Secretary (or Administrator) is required to ensure these securities are in place, either through existing state or local requirements (if they meet a minimum threshold) or by requiring bonds that comply with federal standards. The goal is to protect subcontractors and taxpayers.",
