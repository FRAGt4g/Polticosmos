    "summary": "The Aviation Funding Stability Act of 2025 aims to ensure the continued funding of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) activities during government shutdowns. It mandates that funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, not otherwise appropriated, be used to continue FAA programs, projects, and activities at the previous year's operational rate. The bill outlines the conditions, terms, and duration of such funding, including the charging of expenditures and obligations to the applicable appropriation once a regular appropriation bill or continuing resolution is enacted. It also contains related amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.",
