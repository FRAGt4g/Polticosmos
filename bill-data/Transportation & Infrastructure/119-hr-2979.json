    "summary": "This bill, the Building Up Infrastructure for Local Departments Act of 2025 (or BUILD Act of 2025), authorizes grants to small law enforcement agencies (serving fewer than 50,000 residents) and fire departments (career, combination, and volunteer) to improve facilities. Funds can be used for projects related to emergency services, training, recruitment, community engagement, and community safety. The Attorney General and the Administrator of FEMA will oversee the grant programs, ensuring equitable distribution and reporting to Congress. The bill also mandates studies on construction and renovation needs for both law enforcement and fire departments. Appropriations of $250 million per fiscal year (2026-2028) are authorized for each program.",
