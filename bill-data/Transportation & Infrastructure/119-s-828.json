    "summary": "The School Bus Safety Act of 2025 mandates several safety enhancements for school buses. It requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue rules for: 3-point seat belts, fire suppression and firewall improvements, and event data recorders, automatic emergency braking systems, and electronic stability control systems. It also mandates training hours for bus operators and studies on motion-activated detection and safety belt alerts. A grant program is established to help local agencies purchase or modify buses with these safety features.",
