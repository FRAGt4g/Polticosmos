    "summary": "The Nationwide Permitting Improvement Act (HR 3927) amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to improve nationwide permitting processes for the discharge of dredged or fill material. It extends the term of general permits to ten years, clarifies considerations for environmental effects, and mandates the maintenance of general permits for linear infrastructure projects impacting less than 3 acres of navigable waters. The bill also streamlines reissuance processes for nationwide permits and restricts modifications to existing regulations regarding single and complete projects.",
