    "summary": "The \"Anti-Congestion Tax Act\" conditions federal capital investment grants for New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) on the exemption of certain drivers from congestion fees. It requires that any vehicle paying a toll at the Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, or George Washington Bridge immediately before entering the congestion zone receive a credit equal to that toll. The bill also amends the Internal Revenue Code to create a new federal tax credit for taxpayers who pay these specific crossing tolls, effectively offsetting the cost of the congestion charge.",
