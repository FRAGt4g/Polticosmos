    "summary": "The Interactive Federal Review Act aims to modernize the environmental review process for highway projects. It mandates the Secretary of Transportation to encourage and demonstrate the use of interactive, digital, cloud-based platforms and digital twins in environmental impact analyses and community engagement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The bill defines 'covered projects' eligible for such modernization and requires reports on the efficacy and impact of these technologies, as well as the provision of examples of digital workflows. It also prioritizes projects using these technologies in grant applications.",
