    "summary": "The 'Pilot and Aircraft Privacy Act of 2025' (PAPA Act) aims to limit the use of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. It restricts using ADS-B data to identify aircraft for revenue generation without consent, while allowing its use for air traffic control. The bill also amends existing law to broaden the scope of officials prohibited from specific actions. Furthermore, it introduces regulations regarding fees charged to general aviation aircraft by public-use airports, requiring transparency regarding project costs and impact assessments. ",
