    "summary": "This bill, the Pilot and Aircraft Privacy Act, addresses the use of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data by limiting how it can be used, particularly regarding fees imposed on aircraft and investigations. It restricts the use of ADS-B data for charging aircraft owners and expands the restrictions on federal officials' access to this data. Furthermore, the bill mandates public disclosure requirements for airports planning to impose fees on general aviation aircraft, focusing on transparency and the justification for such fees. It defines 'general aviation aircraft' for the purposes of these fee regulations.",
