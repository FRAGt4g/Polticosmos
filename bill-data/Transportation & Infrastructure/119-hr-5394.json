    "summary": "The 'Freedom from Automated Speed Enforcement Act of 2025' aims to restrict the use of automated speed enforcement systems (e.g., speed cameras) by states.  The bill mandates that the Secretary of Transportation withhold highway funds from states that operate such systems, unless they certify that no jurisdiction within the state uses them. Exceptions are made for school zones and active construction zones under specific conditions. The bill defines an automated speed enforcement system and grants the Secretary of Transportation the power to create regulations.",
