    "summary": "The \"Baby Changing on Board Act\" is a bipartisan bill requiring the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) to equip newly acquired passenger trains with baby changing tables. Specifically, it mandates that all future passenger rail cars owned and operated by Amtrak must have at least one restroom with a baby changing table in each car, including in ADA-compliant restrooms. The bill also requires clear signage to indicate the location of these facilities, aiming to improve accessibility for passengers traveling with infants.",
