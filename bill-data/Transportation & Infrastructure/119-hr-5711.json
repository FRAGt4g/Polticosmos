    "summary": "The Metropolitan Planning Enhancement Act (H.R. 5711) aims to improve transparency and accountability in transportation investment decision-making. The bill amends Titles 23 and 49 of the United States Code to mandate a publicly available and transparent process for selecting projects included in metropolitan and statewide transportation plans. This process involves using clearly defined criteria that support national and state transportation goals, and categorization of projects based on performance. The bill also requires public explanations for the inclusion of lower-ranked projects in priority lists, considering factors like geographic balance and economically distressed areas.",
