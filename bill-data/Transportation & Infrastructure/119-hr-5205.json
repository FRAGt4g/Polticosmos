    "summary": "The Aircraft Noise Reduction Act amends Title 49 of the United States Code to empower owners and operators of general aviation airports to implement aircraft noise limitations. It mandates consultation between the FAA and airport operators to adjust air traffic and training patterns for noncommercial charter flights, considering community input. The bill protects airports from losing federal funding due to noise reduction activities, allows the FAA to reject accommodations in emergencies, and directs the Secretary of Transportation to update regulations to facilitate noise abatement measures.",
