    "summary": "The Aviation Funding Stability Act of 2025 aims to ensure continued funding for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the event of a lapse in appropriations. It allows the FAA to utilize funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for ongoing programs, projects, and activities, subject to specific conditions related to spending rates, duration of funding, and terms. The bill also amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in relation to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. It also dictates what happens if the funding continues past the end of the fiscal year.",
