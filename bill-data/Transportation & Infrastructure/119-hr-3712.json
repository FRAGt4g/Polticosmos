    "summary": "The Complete Streets Act of 2025 mandates that states establish programs promoting 'complete streets,' which are public roads designed to safely accommodate all users, including pedestrians, cyclists, transit users, and vehicles. The bill provides for technical assistance, grants, and the development of complete streets policies and prioritization plans. It also establishes design standards, accessibility guidelines, and reporting requirements for states. The goal is to improve safety and accessibility for all users of the transportation system, prioritizing underserved communities.",
