    "summary": "The 'Make Federal Architecture Beautiful Again Act' mandates a preference for classical and traditional architectural styles in new and renovated federal public buildings. The bill aims to enhance civic pride, reflect national heritage, and ensure aesthetic excellence. It defines key terms like 'classical architecture' and 'preferred architecture,' outlines guiding principles, and directs the General Services Administration (GSA) to implement the policy, including training architects and potentially requiring design competitions that favor traditional styles. The bill also includes notification requirements if the GSA proposes a design diverging from preferred architecture.",
