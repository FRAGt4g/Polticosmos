    "summary": "This bill, the Safeguarding American Tourism Act, aims to exempt large cruise ships (800+ passenger berths) from certain requirements of the Passenger Vessel Services Act (PVSA) and the Jones Act. It also adjusts citizenship, Navy Reserve requirements, and regulations for alien crewmen landing temporarily in the US. The bill's intent is to facilitate tourism, specifically cruise travel, but maintains that the vessel is still subject to all applicable US laws except as explicitly changed by the bill.",
