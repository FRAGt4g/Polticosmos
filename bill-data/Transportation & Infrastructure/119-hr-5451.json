    "summary": "The Aviation Funding Stability Act of 2025 aims to ensure continued funding for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) activities even during government shutdowns. It provides a mechanism to use funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to maintain essential FAA programs and projects. The bill outlines funding rates based on the previous fiscal year's appropriations or continuing resolutions and clarifies the availability, terms, and conditions of these funds. It also includes an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code related to the Trust Fund and specifies that these provisions do not apply if other appropriation laws are in effect.",
