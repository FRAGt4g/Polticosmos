    "summary": "The \"Mobile Post Office Relief Act\" requires the U.S. Postal Service to deploy a mobile retail unit within three business days when a local post office that is not near another facility temporarily shuts down. This applies to facilities closed for 60 days. The mobile unit must provide key services like retail sales, P.O. box mail access, and processing for address changes. This mobile service must continue until the permanent facility reopens. The bill also contains provisions to address facilities that are already closed at the time of the law's enactment, ensuring continued postal access for affected communities.",
