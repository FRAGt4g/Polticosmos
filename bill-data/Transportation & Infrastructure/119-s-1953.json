    "summary": "The Complete Streets Act of 2025 mandates that states establish programs for eligible entities to seek technical assistance and grants for designing and constructing 'complete streets'. These streets are designed to be safe and accessible for all users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to develop benchmarks, guidance, and design standards, with a focus on safety and accessibility. It also amends existing legislation to ensure safe accommodations for all users in transportation projects and establishes complete streets design requirements for federal-aid highways within metropolitan planning areas, with exemptions for certain types of roads.",
