    "summary": "The Highway Funding Transferability Improvement Act aims to increase the flexibility of federal highway funds. Introduced in the Senate by Senator Cramer and Ms. Alsobrooks, the bill amends Title 23 of the United States Code, specifically Section 126(a), to allow for the transfer of up to 75% of Federal-aid highway funds, up from the current 50%. This would give states more financial flexibility for highway projects.",
