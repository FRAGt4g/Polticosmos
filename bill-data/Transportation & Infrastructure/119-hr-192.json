    "summary": "The Amtrak Executive Bonus Disclosure Act (H.R. 192) is a bill that aims to increase corporate transparency at the national passenger railroad. It would amend U.S. law to require Amtrak to report the annual base pay and any bonus compensation paid to members of its executive leadership team. The bill also mandates the disclosure of the specific criteria and metrics used to determine bonus amounts. This information would be required in reports submitted to Congress and, for the first time, made publicly available on Amtrak's website.",
