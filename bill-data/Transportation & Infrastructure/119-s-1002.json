    "summary": "The Deliver for Democracy Act focuses on improving the on-time delivery performance of periodicals by the United States Postal Service (USPS). It mandates that the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) withhold additional rate authority for periodicals if the USPS fails to meet a 95% on-time delivery rate or achieve a 2 percentage point improvement. The bill also requires the Postmaster General to submit annual reports on progress, incorporating performance data for in-county and out-of-county newspaper mail, and directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study alternative pricing schemes to improve the financial position of periodicals.",
