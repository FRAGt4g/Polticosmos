    "summary": "The \"Fast Lane for Youths Act\" (or \"FLY Act\") directs the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Security Administration to collaborate on a new system. Within 180 days of enactment, they must establish a process to expedite gate passes for caregivers, parents, and guardians accompanying minors or passengers who need assistance. The system will provide up to two gate passes for escorts who are already members of TSA Pre-Check, ensuring their passes reflect this status to allow them use of expedited security lanes, thereby simplifying airport navigation for these groups.",
