    "summary": "The Preventing Power Outages Act (S. 1566) amends the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to extend a program aimed at enhancing the resilience of the electric grid. The bill focuses on incorporating the Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI), System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) into the grant allocation process, giving priority to entities with lower reliability (higher SAIDI, SAIFI, or CAIDI scores). It also clarifies grant application conditions related to project scopes and extends the program's funding period to 2027-2031.",
