    "summary": "The Railroad Responsibility Act of 2025 (H.R. 341) aims to empower states to regulate blocked railroad crossings. The bill amends Title 49 of the U.S. Code to specify that federal law does not preempt, or override, a state's authority to create and enforce its own laws limiting the duration that a train can block a public road at a grade crossing. This would allow individual states and the District of Columbia to address local public safety and traffic issues caused by stopped trains without federal preemption.",
