    "summary": "The Noncontiguous Energy Relief and Access Act of 2025 aims to amend U.S. law to facilitate the transportation of energy products on vessels between U.S. points, particularly those in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The bill defines \"covered noncontiguous trade,\" \"energy products,\" and \"energy source,\" providing an exemption to existing restrictions on such transport. Specifically, it allows for the transport of equipment, components, and energy sources used for electricity generation, storage, transmission, and distribution, including petroleum products and liquefied natural gas, between these specified locations.",
