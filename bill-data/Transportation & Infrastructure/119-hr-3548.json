    "summary": "This bill, the Infrastructure Expansion Act of 2025, aims to limit the liability of property owners and contractors involved in infrastructure and transportation projects that receive federal financial assistance. It specifically addresses 'absolute liability' claims, replacing them with a comparative negligence standard. The bill also preempts state laws that impose absolute liability and places claims arising under the act under exclusive federal court jurisdiction. It defines key terms like 'absolute liability,' 'covered person,' and 'elevation or gravity-related risk,' and sets an effective date. It specifies that workers' compensation laws are not impacted.",
