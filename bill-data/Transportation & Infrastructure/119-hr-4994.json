    "summary": "The 'Safe Air on Airplanes Act' (H.R. 4994) mandates the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to update regulations regarding bleed air systems in aircraft. It prohibits new aircraft designs from using these systems, requires filters/air cleaning devices on newly manufactured aircraft with bleed air systems, and phases out the use of such systems in existing aircraft designs over a 30-year period. The bill aims to improve air quality within aircraft to protect passengers and crew.",
