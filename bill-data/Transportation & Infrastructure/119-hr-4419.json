    "summary": "The Autonomous Vehicle Accessibility Act (H.R. 4419) aims to prevent states from issuing motor vehicle operator's licenses for Level 4 or 5 ADS-equipped vehicles in a way that discriminates against individuals with disabilities. It defines key terms related to autonomous vehicles and disabilities. The bill mandates a study by the Secretary of Transportation and the National Academies to identify infrastructure improvements to enhance accessibility for ride-hail ADS-equipped vehicles, focusing on areas like pickup/drop-off zones and technological solutions. It authorizes $5,000,000 for the study.",
