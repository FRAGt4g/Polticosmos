    "summary": "This bill, the Beautifying Federal Civic Architecture Act of 2025, aims to promote traditional and classical architecture for federal public buildings. It establishes guiding principles emphasizing designs that uplift public spaces, inspire the human spirit, and command respect. The bill defines key terms, including \"applicable Federal public buildings\" and various architectural styles. It mandates the General Services Administration (GSA) adhere to these principles, update its policies, and appoint a Senior Advisor for Architectural Design. It also requires the GSA to notify the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy of design choices diverging from the preferred architecture.",
