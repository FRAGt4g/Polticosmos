    "summary": "The Rails to Trails Landowner Rights Act (H.R. 4924) amends the National Trails System Act to provide additional protections for landowners adjacent to abandoned railway rights-of-way that are being considered for interim recreational use as trails. It mandates notice to landowners and local governments, requires signed landowner approval, mandates compensation for the landowner at fair market value, requires a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed use, and establishes an advisory committee to recommend maintenance requirements. The bill aims to protect landowner rights and ensure fair treatment in the conversion of railway corridors to trails.",
