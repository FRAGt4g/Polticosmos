    "summary": "H.R. 5667 proposes to ensure the continued operation of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the event of a government shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations. The bill appropriates necessary funds for the FAA's operation, limiting the funding to either 30 days or the duration of the shutdown, whichever is shorter. This aims to prevent disruption of air travel and related services during a funding crisis.",
