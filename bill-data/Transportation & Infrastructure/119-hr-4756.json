    "summary": "The Freights First Act aims to amend United States Code Title 49, concerning transportation. Specifically, it limits the preference given to Amtrak (passenger rail) when using rail lines, junctions, and crossings located within 50 miles of a port or rail yard. The bill intends to prioritize freight transportation in these areas, except in emergencies, ensuring freight transport isn't unduly delayed by passenger rail services.",
