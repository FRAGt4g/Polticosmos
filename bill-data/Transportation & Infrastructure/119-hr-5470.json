    "summary": "This bill, the Route 66 National Historic Trail Designation Act, amends the National Trails System Act to designate Route 66 as a National Historic Trail. It outlines the trail's general route, administration by the National Park Service, and limitations on land acquisition and eminent domain. Crucially, it clarifies that the designation does not create buffer zones, hinder energy development, grant new permitting requirements, or designate the trail as part of the National Park System. The bill aims to preserve and recognize the historic significance of Route 66.",
