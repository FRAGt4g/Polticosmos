    "summary": "This bill, the PHMSA Voluntary Information Sharing Act, aims to improve pipeline safety by establishing a confidential, voluntary information-sharing system (VIS). The VIS will encourage the sharing of pipeline safety data and information related to gas transmission, gas distribution, and hazardous liquid pipelines, among others. A governing board with diverse stakeholders will oversee the VIS, supported by a Program Manager and Third-Party Data Manager. The VIS will gather and analyze data, share best practices, and issue reports. Data sharing is voluntary, with confidentiality and protections against use in litigation as key components.",
