    "summary": "This bill, the Broadband Expansion And Deployment Fee Equity and Efficiency Act of 2025 (BEAD FEE Act of 2025), amends the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. It aims to streamline fees charged by states and political subdivisions for broadband infrastructure projects to qualify for federal grant funds under the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD). The bill mandates that these fees be competitively neutral, technology-neutral, nondiscriminatory, publicly disclosed, and based on actual costs. It also requires clear descriptions of fees to requesting parties, distinguishing between different fee types and infrastructure situations.",
