    "summary": "The Safer Emergency and Evacuation Routes Response Act of 2025 mandates the Secretary of Transportation to create a voluntary pilot program. This program aims to integrate real-time wildfire hazard alerts with State and local transportation closure information systems. The goal is to improve the communication of roadway closures and evacuation routes to drivers during wildfire events. The act ensures the use of existing data standards, no requirement for uniform systems, and flexibility for participating states. The Secretary will evaluate the program's effectiveness after two years.",
