It mandates vulnerability assessments for bridges built before 1996, establishes a risk reduction plan for those exceeding safety thresholds, and integrates assessment data into the National Bridge Inventory. It also creates an interdisciplinary bridge safety team and a grant program for bridge assessments and improvements. The bill authorizes $500 million for grants between 2026 and 2030.",
