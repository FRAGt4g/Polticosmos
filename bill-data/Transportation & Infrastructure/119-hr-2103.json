    "summary": "The Protect Postal Performance Act aims to modify procedures for the closure or consolidation of U.S. post offices and processing/distribution centers. It mandates public hearings for closures, requires summaries of these hearings be published online, and sets waiting periods before closures can occur. The bill also restricts closures of post offices in areas with limited postal access and prohibits closures of processing centers in states without any processing centers and establishes new rules governing mail processing facilities and limits on transportation optimization efforts by the USPS.",
