    "summary": "The 'Beautifying Federal Civic Architecture Act of 2025' mandates that federal public buildings should be designed to uplift public spaces, inspire the human spirit, and command respect. It establishes guiding principles emphasizing preferred architectural styles, particularly classical and traditional, with significant input from local communities. The bill defines key terms like 'applicable Federal public building' and 'preferred architecture,' and sets GSA requirements, including mandatory training for employees and establishment of a Senior Advisor. Any divergence from preferred architecture requires notification to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. An annual report to Congress is mandated. ",
