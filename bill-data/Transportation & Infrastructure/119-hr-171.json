    "summary": "This bipartisan bill, the \"Make Transportation Authorities Accountable and Transparent Act,\" directs the Department of Transportation's Inspector General to audit the five largest public transit agencies. The audit will scrutinize their use of federal funds over the past five years, with a specific focus on money from major COVID-19 relief laws like the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan. The purpose is to ensure accountability in how this aid was spent. The Inspector General must report the findings to Congress within 180 days of the bill's enactment.",
