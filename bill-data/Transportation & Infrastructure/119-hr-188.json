    "summary": "This bill, the \"Amtrak Transparency and Accountability for Passengers and Taxpayers Act,\" aims to increase government transparency by requiring Amtrak's Board of Directors to comply with the open meetings requirements of the Government in the Sunshine Act. This would generally make board meetings open to the public. The bill also specifies exemptions, allowing Amtrak to hold closed sessions to discuss sensitive topics such as contract negotiations, collective bargaining agreements with unions, and specific personnel matters in order to protect its competitive and operational interests.",
