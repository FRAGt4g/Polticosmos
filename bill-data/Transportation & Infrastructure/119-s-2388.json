    "summary": "The Water Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2025 reauthorizes a pilot program for alternative water source projects and defines \"intelligent water infrastructure technology.\" It amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to specify eligible uses for grant funds, including intelligent infrastructure technology implementation, and prohibits use for planning, feasibility studies, operation, or maintenance. It mandates reporting to Congress on grant recipients and the resulting improvements in resiliency, and increases the authorized funding level. The bill aims to improve water systems through technological advancements.",
