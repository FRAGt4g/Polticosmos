    "summary": "The Small Projects Expedited Execution and Delivery Act (SPEED Act) amends MAP-21, a previous transportation bill.  It modifies the provisions concerning categorical exclusions for projects receiving limited federal assistance. Notably, the bill increases the dollar thresholds defining these projects, effectively expanding the scope of projects eligible for expedited review and reducing regulatory burdens. This relates to infrastructure spending and project efficiency.",
