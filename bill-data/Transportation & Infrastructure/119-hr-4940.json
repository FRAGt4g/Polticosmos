    "summary": "The 'Accommodating Individuals Requesting Familial Assistance in Riding Efficiently Act' (AIRFARE Act) aims to expedite airport gate pass and flight access procedures. It mandates the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to establish a system within 180 days to allow caregivers, parents, and guardians to accompany minors and passengers needing assistance to their flights.  The bill allows for up to two gate passes, potentially utilizing TSA Pre-Check benefits, and specifies requirements related to wheelchair usage. This bill focuses on facilitating smoother travel for those needing familial or caregiving support within the context of air travel.",
