    "summary": "Introduced by Representatives Burchett and Bishop, the \"Trailer Safety Improvement Act\" amends U.S. law to enhance road safety. The bill requires state highway safety programs to include educational components focused on trailers. Specifically, it mandates efforts to prevent the improper and unsafe use of light-duty and medium-duty trailers. It also requires educating the public about necessary trailer safety equipment, preventive maintenance, and the dangers of unsecured vehicle loads. The goal is to reduce trailer-related accidents by increasing public awareness and promoting safer practices on the nation's highways.",
