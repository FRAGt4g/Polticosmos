    "summary": "The Aviation-Impacted Communities Act aims to mitigate the negative impacts of aircraft noise on communities near airports. It mandates the FAA to provide funding for noise mitigation measures in impacted areas, establishes community boards to address noise concerns, and commissions a National Academy of Sciences study to develop a framework and diagnostic tool for assessing aviation impacts. The bill outlines a process for community designation, assessment, and the creation of action plans to reduce noise pollution. It also authorizes appropriations for noise mitigation grants and FAA administration.",
