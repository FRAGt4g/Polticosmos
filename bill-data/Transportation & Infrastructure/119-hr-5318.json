    "summary": "This bill, the Reducing Antiquated Permitting for Infrastructure Deployment Act (RAPID Act), aims to streamline the deployment of small personal wireless service facilities. It exempts such facilities from certain environmental and historical preservation reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the National Historic Preservation Act. The bill also establishes a presumption regarding Indian Tribe involvement in FCC form submissions, specifying conditions for presumptions of good faith by applicants and disclaimers of interest by tribes, as well as outlining ways to overcome those presumptions. Key definitions, including \"small personal wireless service facility\" and \"Commission\" (Federal Communications Commission), are provided.",
