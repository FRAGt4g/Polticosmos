    "summary": "The 'Don't Cut FAA Workers Act of 2025' amends Title 49 of the United States Code to prevent mass layoffs of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees within one year of a major aviation accident. It defines 'mass layoff' based on the number of employees affected, and 'major aviation accident' as an accident resulting in a fatal injury. The Administrator can only carry out a mass layoff if Congress approves it via a joint resolution within 60 days of notification.",
