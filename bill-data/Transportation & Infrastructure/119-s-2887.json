    "summary": "This bill, the Route 66 National Historic Trail Designation Act, aims to designate the historic Route 66 as a National Historic Trail. It amends the National Trails System Act to include Route 66, outlining its approximate route from Chicago to Santa Monica. The bill specifies administration by the Secretary of the Interior, with provisions for tribal consultation, land acquisition limitations, and clarifies the designation's impact on energy development, eminent domain, and existing easements/rights-of-way. It emphasizes a hands-off approach, preventing the designation from creating buffer zones or new permitting requirements.",
