    "summary": "The Infrastructure Project Acceleration Act aims to expedite the approval process for large-scale manufacturing projects in the United States. It defines \"priority manufacturing projects\" based on cost and the need for federal approvals. The bill seeks to strengthen the economy, enhance technological competitiveness, and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturing. It exempts priority projects from certain environmental regulations, amends NEPA, and limits judicial review of approval decisions, while granting the DC Circuit exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the Act's legality.",
