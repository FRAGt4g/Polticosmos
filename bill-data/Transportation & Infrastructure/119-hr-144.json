    "summary": "This bill, the \"Tennessee Valley Authority Salary Transparency Act,\" requires the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to submit an annual report to Congress. This report must detail the names, salaries, and duties of all management-level employees, executives, and board members earning compensation at or above the federal GS-15 pay grade. Introduced as a bipartisan measure, the bill aims to increase congressional oversight of TVA's executive compensation. However, it also explicitly shields this specific salary information from public disclosure by exempting it from the Freedom of Information Act and the Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act.",
