    "summary": "This bill, the \"Stop DC Capital Authoritarian Motorvehicle Enforcement and Restoration of Autonomy Act\" (or Stop DC CAMERA Act), aims to restrict the District of Columbia's authority. It repeals the city's ability to use automated traffic enforcement systems (e.g., speed cameras) and to prohibit right turns at red lights through signage. The bill would eliminate existing sections of the D.C. Official Code related to these traffic regulations.",
