    "summary": "The Magnus White Cyclist Safety Act of 2025 mandates the Secretary of Transportation to establish rules for automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems in new vehicles. These systems must function in various lighting conditions, meet speed thresholds, and detect/respond to vulnerable road users, considering different skin tones and protective gear. The bill defines key terms like 'covered vehicle' and 'vulnerable road user' and sets a compliance timeframe, ensuring systems are in place within two model years after the final rule's issuance.",
