    "summary": "The Abandoned Vessel Prevention Act amends Title 46 of the United States Code to address liability for the sinking of decommissioned commercial vessels.  It assigns liability to those who transfer title of commercial vessels (or former commercial vessels) to be used recreationally, if the transferee lacks the required insurance and the vessel subsequently sinks, leading to specified expenses. Exemptions exist for vessels under 35 feet or less than 40 years old, or if insurance is in place.  The bill aims to prevent environmental damage and financial burdens from abandoned vessels.",
