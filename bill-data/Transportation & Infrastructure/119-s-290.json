    "summary": "The 'Making National Parks Safer Act' mandates the Secretary of the Interior to assess and upgrade emergency communication centers within the National Park System to Next Generation 9-1-1 systems. It requires an assessment of current implementation status, cost estimates, and a report to Congress. A plan for implementation will be developed, taking into account interoperability with state and local officials and consultation with relevant federal agencies, while allowing for exceptions where sufficient systems are already in place.",
