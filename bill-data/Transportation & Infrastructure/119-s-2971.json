    "summary": "The Plant Safety Authorities Coordination Act of 2025 amends Title 49 of the United States Code to redefine \"transporting gas.\" It aims to exclude certain gas movements within or near a plant from this definition. Specifically, it clarifies that the term does not include gas gathering outside populated areas (except through regulated lines) and movement of gas within a plant for plant operations, including through in-plant or short transfer piping systems (less than 1 mile).",
