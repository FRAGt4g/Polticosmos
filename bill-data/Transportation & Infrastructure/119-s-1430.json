    "summary": "The Interactive Federal Review Act aims to improve the environmental review process for highway projects. It mandates the Secretary of Transportation to encourage the use of interactive digital platforms and 3D digital models (digital twins) for environmental impact analyses and community engagement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The bill defines \"covered projects\" eligible for the program, requiring at least 10 projects to demonstrate the technology's effectiveness. It also requires reports on efficiency, community engagement, and examples of its use, promoting transparency and stakeholder involvement.",
