Furthermore, it mandates the establishment of new CAFE and greenhouse gas emissions standards for passenger and heavy-duty vehicles, and authorizes appropriations. The bill includes provisions for consultation with stakeholders and adjustments to standards based on market conditions, with deemed compliance clauses for manufacturers.",
