    "summary": "H.R. 81, the \"Travel Mask Mandate Repeal Act of 2025,\" seeks to prohibit any federal agency from imposing a mask requirement on public transportation due to COVID-19. The bill would immediately nullify the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's January 2021 order that established the travel mask mandate, along with related Transportation Security Administration directives. This legislation aims to prevent the federal government from enforcing or creating future mask mandates for individuals using public conveyances like airplanes and trains or facilities like airports and stations.",
