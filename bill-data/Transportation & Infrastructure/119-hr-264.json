    "summary": "The Train Establishment of Appetizing Table Service Act (Train EATS Act) amends U.S. law to mandate food services on Amtrak's overnight routes. It requires Amtrak to offer both traditional, sit-down dining and a more affordable alternative service. Any unused traditional dining capacity must be made available to coach passengers for a fee. This bill stipulates that traditional dining must include healthy meal options and accommodate dietary restrictions upon pre-order. The Secretary of Transportation is tasked with issuing regulations to implement these requirements for all routes departing and arriving on different dates.",
