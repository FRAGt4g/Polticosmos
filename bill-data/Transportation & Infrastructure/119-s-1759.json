    "summary": "This bill, the Supersonic Aviation Modernization Act, aims to allow civil supersonic flights within the United States' national airspace. It directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue or revise regulations, specifically referencing section 91.817 of the Code of Federal Regulations, to permit supersonic flight without special authorization. The key condition is that the aircraft must operate in a way that prevents sonic booms from reaching the ground in the United States.",
