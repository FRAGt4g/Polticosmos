    "summary": "The Safety Funding Parity Adjustment Act of 2025 (S. 2917) grants the Secretary of Transportation the authority to adjust highway safety funding (Sections 402 and 405 of Title 23, United States Code). The bill outlines a process for the Secretary to determine if funding for these sections has increased over the prior year. Depending on the relative increases in Section 402 and 405 funding, the Secretary may be required to shift funding between the two sections to ensure a specific ratio of increase. The bill takes effect in October 2026.",
