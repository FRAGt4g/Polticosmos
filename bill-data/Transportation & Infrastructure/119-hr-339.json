    "summary": "The Broadband Resiliency and Flexible Investment Act amends the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 to streamline the approval process for modifying existing wireless and telecommunications facilities. The bill requires state and local governments to approve requests for modifications that do not substantially change a structure's physical dimensions. It establishes a 60-day timeframe for review; if a government fails to act, the request is automatically \"deemed approved.\" The legislation also limits the documentation local authorities can require, grants providers the right to seek enforcement in federal court, and directs the FCC to issue implementation rules.",
