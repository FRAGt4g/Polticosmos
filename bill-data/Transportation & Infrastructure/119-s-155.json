    "summary": "This bill, the MAILS Act, aims to improve communication between the U.S. Postal Service and local communities regarding the relocation and establishment of postal retail facilities. It mandates the Postal Service to establish a process for local governments to request new post offices, amends existing regulations to require community input and notification for temporary relocations, and mandates periodic updates on the status of such relocations. Furthermore, the bill requires the Postal Service to submit reports to relevant Congressional committees and members for temporary relocations exceeding 180 days, detailing communication adherence and any extension justifications.",
